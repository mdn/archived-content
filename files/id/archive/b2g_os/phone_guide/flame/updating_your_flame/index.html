<div class="summary">
<p>This article covers how to update the software on your Flame — including updating Firefox OS and pushing new apps to your phone — along with backing up your data, and other useful troubleshooting and testing information. Before starting to do any of this, you should make sure you have run through the <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/Flame/Initial_setup">Initial setup</a> information.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Quick_guide_to_updating_your_device">Quick guide to updating your device</h2>

<p>There is a lot of information in this article, so here we&apos;ve included a quick start guide that takes you through the steps you need quickly to get your device updated. You can refer to the below sections for more detail if it is needed.</p>

<h3 id="Full_flash_to_the_latest_base_image">Full flash to the latest base image</h3>

<p>This set of steps needs to be done before you do anything else to your phone (see <a href="#Base_image">Base image</a> and <a href="#Base_image_installation">Base image installation</a> if you require more details.)</p>

<div id="magicdomid12"><span class="author-p-18262"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Make sure you have adb and fastboot installed and available in your system&apos;s <code>PATH</code> (see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB">Installing ADB and Fastboot</a>.)</span><br>

<h4 id="Update_channel_reset_bug">Update channel reset bug</h4>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1217490" title="FIXED: [Aries] The dogfood/dogfood-latest channel are reset to nightly after latest OTA">bug 1217490</a>, some Firefox OS testers testing Firefox OS 2.5 latest OTA updates (on Flame, but also on other dogfooding devices) may find that when they install an OTA update, their update channel is reset to <code>nightly</code>, meaning that they won’t receive subsequent OTA updates coming through other channels. To avoid this, it is recommended that you set your  update channel to <code>nightly-latest</code> in the Firefox OS settings via WebIDE. To do this:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Plug your phone into your computer via USB (make sure <em>Debugging via USB</em> is set to <em>ADB and DevTools</em> in the Phone&apos;s <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings">Developer Settings</a>)</li>
 <li>Go to Firefox Desktop and open <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a>.</li>
 <li>Connect WebIDE to your phone by selecting it under <em>USB Devices</em>. Accept the connection prompt that appears on your phone.</li>
 <li>Under <em>Other</em> on the right hand side of the WebIDE UI, select <em>Device Settings</em>.</li>
 <li>Find <code>app.update.channel</code> in the list, and change the setting value in the corresponding textbox to <code>nightly-latest</code>.</li>
 <li>Find <code>app.update.channel.backup</code> and change the setting value to <code>nightly-latest</code> if you want it to persist after further updates.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Shallow_Flash_to_the_latest_Firefox_OS_nightly_(Gaia_and_Gecko)">Shallow Flash to the latest Firefox OS nightly (Gaia and Gecko)</h3>

<p>This set of steps only needs to be done if you want to update to the VERY latest builds (see <a href="#Updating_your_Flame_to_a_nightly_build">Updating your Flame to a nightly build</a> if you require more details.)</p>

<div id="magicdomid50"><span class="author-p-18262"><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Windows users will need to install <a href="https://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, which provides a Linux-like environment on Windows.</span><span class="author-p-18262"> The instructions below include steps for how to automatically install the appropriate packages if you don&apos;t already have it installed.</span></div>

</div>

<h3 id="Base_Image_installation">Base Image installation</h3>

<p>To install the base image on your device:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure remote debugging is enabled on your Flame, using the <em>Remote debugging/Debugging via USB</em> option in the device&apos;s <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings#Debugging_via_USB">Developer settings</a> (the option is different, depending on whether you have Firefox 1.3 and under, or Firefox 1.4+ installed).</li>
 <li>Connect your Flame to your computer via a USB cable if it isn&apos;t already. Verify that the computer is connected to the device by running the <code>adb devices</code> command in a terminal.</li>
 <li>Download the base image <code>.zip</code> file referenced above. Unzip it onto your Desktop.</li>
 <li>Go into the directory you extracted the software into and run it:
  <ul>
   <li>On Windows, enter the directory in your command prompt, then run the <code>flash.bat</code> script using <code>flash.bat</code> (or double click the file in explorer).<br>
    <strong>Note</strong>: If <code>flash.bat </code>is missing, simply rename the <code>flash.sh</code> file to <code>flash.bat</code>, then run that. Make sure you have <code>adb</code> and <code>fastboot</code> installed and available on <code>PATH</code>.</li>
   <li>On Linux / OSX, enter the directory in your terminal, then run the <code>flash.sh</code> script using <code>./flash.sh</code> (previous instructions encouraged you to use sudo. Don&apos;t. It is <strong>really dangerous</strong> to use sudo with things you download from the Internet. If the flash script fails to see your device, please double-check that your <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites#For_Linux.3A_configure_the_udev_rule_for_your_phone">udev rules</a> are correct). If you do not see a <code>flash.sh</code> file, simply rename <code>flash.bat</code> to <code>flash.sh</code> first and then use the above command.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get a &quot;permission denied&quot; error when running the above commands, your shell script probably doesn&apos;t have the right permissions. Running <code>chmod +x flash.sh</code> on it should solve this problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If the flash script gets stuck at &quot;&lt; waiting for device &gt;&quot; while the display shows &quot;ThunderSoft(R)&quot;, the script doesn&apos;t have permission to access the device while in fastboot mode. You need to setup the <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Firefox_OS_build_prerequisites#For_Linux.3A_configure_the_udev_rule_for_your_phone">udev rules</a> to give it access. Also USB 3 ports may not work well with fastboot and can be the cause of this problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You are also welcome to build your own builds to install on the Flame: see <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Building_and_installing_Firefox_OS">Building and installing Firefox OS</a>.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="Font_fix">Font fix</h4>

<div class="warning notecard">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This step is only needed for base image v180.</p>
</div>

<p>After updating Gecko and Gaia to nightly with the v180 base image, there will be a mismatch between the fonts that Gecko and Gaia expects and what the base image provides (this has been fixed as of v188). To fix this, you have two choices:</p>

<ul>
 <li>download our <a href="https://people.mozilla.org/~mwu/fira-font-update.zip">font update package</a>, extract it, navigate into the directory created by extracting, and run the supplied <code>flash.sh</code> script.</li>
 <li>use the <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-TWQA/B2G-flash-tool/blob/master/update_system_fonts.sh"><code>update_system_fonts.sh</code></a> script, which will download and flash the system fonts automatically.</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A &quot;shallow flash&quot; updates <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko">Gecko</a> and <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gaia">Gaia</a> plus data directories, as opposed to a full flash, which updates Gecko/Gaia, but also the underlying <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Gonk">Gonk</a> layer and associated binaries particular to that device type. This is why it is a good idea to update to the official <a href="#Base Image">base image</a> first, as suggested above, then shallow flash over the top of that, once you&apos;ve got the Gonk/binary layer right.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can check the update status of each build on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G/QA/Flame_OTA">the Flame OTA status page</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Once the install procedure finishes the phone should reboot into the updated build and display the first time user workflow.</p>

<h4 id="Switch_to_nightly_update_channel">Switch to nightly update channel</h4>

<p>In v2.2 you can change the <strong>Update channel</strong> from <code>default</code> to <code>nightly</code> under <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings#Update_channel">Developer settings</a>.</p>

<p>Below is the older method, if you don&apos;t find that setting in your device.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure remote debugging is enabled on your Flame, using the <em>Remote debugging/Debugging via USB</em> option in the device&apos;s <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings">Developer settings</a>.</li>
 <li>Download the <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-TWQA/B2G-flash-tool/blob/master/change_channel.sh">change channel</a> script: follow the link, press the <em>Raw</em> button, then use your browser&apos;s save functionality to save the page directly as <code>change_channel.sh</code>.</li>
 <li>In your Terminal, <code>cd</code> into the directory you saved the script in and change the update channel on your phone using the following command:<br>

  <pre class="brush: bash">./change_channel.sh -v nightly</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Once the phone reboots, check for updates by going into <em>Settings &gt; Device information &gt; Check now.</em></li>
</ol>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This step isn&apos;t needed in newer versions of the Firefox OS software — you should just get OTA updates automatically.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can choose between several different update channels. Run &quot;<code>./change_channel.sh -h</code>&quot; to see the other channel options.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Fastboot_mode">Fastboot mode</h3>

<p>If flashing a new build to your phone fails to work, your phone may become unresponsive, leading to the phone rebooting in recovery mode. The recovery mode provides few options (<em>Reboot</em>, <em>Update from adb</em>, <em>Wipe data</em>, <em>Wipe cache</em>, and <em>Update from sdcard</em>). Unfortunately, selecting <em>Update from adb</em> triggers a sideload mode in which you cannot use the other adb commands. The <code>adb sideload</code> command would work but the various flash scripts rely on other adb commands.</p>

<p>You can force fastboot mode as follows:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Power off the phone (which may involve removing the battery in extreme cases...).</li>
 <li>Plug in the USB cable.</li>
 <li>Power the phone up again by pressing the Volume Down and Power buttons together.</li>
</ol>

<p>The phone should now display the text &quot;FASTBOOT&quot;: it is in fastboot mode and is waiting for a USB connection. At this point, a USB-connected, computer with adb installed should see the phone listed when the <code>fastboot devices</code> command is run. Note that regular adb would not see the device — only fastboot sees it. In this mode, you can use the flash script to install the last <a href="#Base Image">base image</a> as explained above. As the script does use both adb and fastboot commands, you may see some initial error and warnings from adb, but the device should be flashed properly at the end of the procedure.</p>

<h3 id="Emergency_download_mode">Emergency download mode</h3>

<p>If flashing a new build to your phone fails to work, your phone becomes unresponsive, and the phone cannot enter fastboot mode, you can use emergency mode for recovery. You&apos;ll need the provided emergency USB cable with the “Recovery Cable” red label on it and the <a href="http://cds.w5v8t3u9.hwcdn.net/Flame_Rescure_Tool_(updated_with_tutorial).zip">Emergency Download Tool</a> to enter this mode. For full instructions, see the Flame emergency rescue tool tutorial included in the download tool&apos;s files. Contact the device maker (flameservice [at] thundersoft.com) if you need any more technical support.</p>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The tool provided is Windows-only.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Recovery_mode">Recovery mode</h3>

<p>You can enter recovery mode to clear your phone data or manually update the firmware. There are two ways to enter this mode:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB">ADB</a> tools are available, make sure Remote debugging is turned on in the phone&apos;s <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings#Remote_debugging">Developer settings</a>, connect your phone to your computer via USB and enter <code>adb reboot recovery</code> on the command line.</li>
 <li>If your phone is powered off, press the Volume Up + Power buttons together.</li>
</ul>

<p>When in recovery mode, press the Volume up/down keys to move the selection highlight, and the Power key to select. Make sure you have your phone data (Contacts, SMS, etc.) backed up before clearing data, and your upgrade packages downloaded before updating.</p>

<h2 id="Backing_up_and_restoring_your_Flame_data">Backing up and restoring your Flame data</h2>

<p>When using a Flame, you won&apos;t want to lose your phone&apos;s contacts and other data while upgrading to a new build (as explained earlier in this article). To backup and restore data you can use our Backup and restore profile tool, which is contained in the <a href="https://github.com/Mozilla-TWQA/B2G-flash-tool">B2G-flash-tool Git repo</a>.</p>

<ol>
 <li>To use this, first open up your terminal/command line.</li>
 <li>Clone the above repo (you&apos;ll need <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads">Git installed</a>) using
  <pre class="brush: bash">git clone https://github.com/Mozilla-TWQA/B2G-flash-tool</pre>
 </li>
 <li>The tool is a Python file: <code>backup_restore_profile.py</code>. Make sure you have <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python installed</a> (2.7.x is probably best.) Linux and Mac systems should have this out of the box.</li>
 <li>Enter the directory you just cloned using <code>cd B2G-flash-tool</code>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: When using this tool, you&apos;ll also need to make sure that your phone is connected via USB to your computer, and that ADB (see <a href="#Important_steps_to_follow_first">Important steps to follow first</a> above) and Debugging via USB (in your device&apos;s <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Developer_settings">Developer settings</a>) are enabled.</p>
</div>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get a message complaining about lack of permissions to execute this file, <code>cd</code> into the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">chmod +x backup_restore_profile.py</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="Backing_up_data_from_your_phone">Backing up data from your phone</h3>

<p>Before backing up you should make sure your device is updated with the most recent OTA update. To do this, on your phone go to <em>Settings app &gt; Device Information &gt; Check for updates &gt; click Check Now</em>. If there is an update available, you should shortly get a notification of an available update. Choose to install the update.</p>

<p>Now, in the directory where you saved the <code>backup_restore_profile.py</code> file, run the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">python backup_restore_profile.py -b</pre>

<p>This should save your device profile to a directory called <code>mozilla-profile</code>, in the same directory as the script is located.</p>

<div class="warning notecard">
<p>Warning: by default, it does not save the internal sd card content. So files like photos or videos from the gallery app will not be saved. If you want to backup the sd card content, add the --sdcard option</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">python backup_restore_profile.py -b --sdcard</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="Restoring_data_to_your_phone">Restoring data to your phone</h3>

<p>Before restoring you should again make sure your device is updated with the most recent OTA update. Go to <em>Settings app &gt; Device Information &gt; Check for updates &gt; click Check Now</em>. If there is an update available, you should shortly get a notification of an available update. Choose to install the update.</p>

<p>In the directory where your <code>mozilla-profile</code> directory is located (see above section), run the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">python backup_restore_profile.py -r</pre>

<div class="note notecard">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can get a list of all the options the tool supports by running <code>python backup_restore_profile.py -h</code>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Pushing_apps_to_your_Flame">Pushing apps to your Flame</h2>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager">App Manager</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE">WebIDE</a> tools make it easy to push apps to your phone, for testing, etc.</p>

<h2 id="RAM_adjustment">RAM adjustment</h2>

<p>You can adjust the available RAM capacity to see how apps perform on Firefox OS phones with lower memory footprints.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by entering fastboot mode (install fastboot first, which is available on the same SDK page as <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Debugging/Installing_ADB">ADB</a>) and typing:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">adb reboot bootloader
fastboot oem mem [0|256-1024]</pre>

<p>“0” is the memory automatically detected and “256-1024” is the number of megabytes. For example, if you want to adjust device RAM capacity to 512M, enter <code>fastboot oem mem 512</code>.</p>

<p>You&apos;ll need to then reboot your device for the settings to take effect. This can be done using:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">fastboot reboot</pre>

<p>The current memory size can be returned by entering fastboot mode and typing:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">fastboot getvar mem
</pre>
