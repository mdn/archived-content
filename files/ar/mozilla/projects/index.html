Midas can be enabled via JavaScript on an HTML document. When Midas is enabled, the document becomes editable by the user. Scripting for Midas is based on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533049.aspx">DHTML commands</a> supported by Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer supports the ability to make an entire document editable by setting the <code>designMode</code> property of the <a href="/ar/docs/Web/API/Document" title="The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree."><code><bdi>document</bdi></code></a> object; this is how Midas is invoked in Gecko. Internet Explorer also supports the ability to edit specific elements using the <code>contentEditable</code> attribute; Starting with Firefox 3, Gecko also supports <code>contentEditable</code>. Once Midas is invoked, a few more methods of the <code>document</code> object become available.</dd></dl></dl></div>
