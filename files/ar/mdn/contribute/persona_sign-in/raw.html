<div class="syntaxbox">Currently, MDN lets contributors sign in using two different authentication providers: Mozilla Persona and GitHub. Starting on November 1, 2016, we will remove Persona as an option for logging in. Therefore, you must enable Github authentication on your profile to avoid losing login access to MDN.</div>
</div>

<p>We recognize that this is an inconvenience, and we do apologize for it. Unfortunately, this is out of our control.</p>

<h2 id="Why_is_Persona_being_removed">Why is Persona being removed?</h2>

<p>Mozilla has shut down the Persona project, and its servers will be turned off in November, 2016. You can <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_Shutdown_Guidelines_for_Reliers#FAQs">learn more about Mozilla's decision</a> to shut down Persona on the Mozilla wiki.</p>

<h2 id="When_will_Persona_be_removed">When will Persona be removed?</h2>

<p>We will disable Persona as an authentication provider on November 1, 2016; in other words, the last day you'll be able to sign in to MDN using Persona will be October 31, 2016. We will be issuing increasingly frequent and increasingly urgent notifications to <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Link_a_GitHub_account">add a GitHub account to your MDN profile</a> starting now. Please do this as soon as you can, in order to avoid any risk of losing access to your MDN account.</p>

<h2 id="Will_MDN_offer_another_authentication_provider">Will MDN offer another authentication provider?</h2>

<p>We would very much like to do so, but have not yet identified another provider which meets our requirements; in addition, we don't currently have the developer resources to integrate another provider. For the time being, your <em>only</em> option to keep contributor access to MDN is to <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Link_a_GitHub_account">link your MDN profile to your GitHub account</a>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, of course, that you don't need to sign in to MDN in order to read our content. But if you have an account for contributing, and wish to be able to contribute at any time in the future, be sure to <em><strong>add a GitHub account to your profile as soon as you can,</strong></em> before October 31, 2016.</p>
