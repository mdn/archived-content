<h3 id="QMO_Event_Page"><a name="event"></a>QMO Event Page</h3>

<p>The week before a testday we need to create a QMO event page.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Once you are logged in (yes you need to be authenticated) simply click on the left to add a <a href="https://quality.mozilla.org/wp-admin/post-new.php">new post</a></li>
 <li>Your title should indicate the topic and date (ie. Firefox Aurora Bugday May 6th)</li>
 <li>Start out by giving a small summary of the topic, goals, and when the event takes place.</li>
 <li>Give some context as to why this event/activity is necessary and valuable.</li>
 <li>Give some encouragement for people who have absolutely no experience to attend.</li>
 <li>Frame the language of your post with "making Firefox better", show them what benefit their contributions provide (no matter how big or small).</li>
 <li>Provide a link to your testplan etherpad and a mibbit URL so people without IRC clients can join easily.</li>
 <li>Be sure to thank them in advance for attending.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an example of an excellent <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/events/2011/02/28/add-ons-compatibility-and-add-ons-manager-testday-march-4th/">QMO Event</a> page. <strong>Before posting make sure you:</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>"Is this post an event?" is set to "Yes" below</li>
 <li>"All day event?" is unchecked and the date/times are properly set (all times in PDT)</li>
 <li>All other event details can be left blank</li>
 <li>On the right under "Categories", check "Events", "QMO News" and any appropriate "Teams"</li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong> (if you have to, get someone else to review)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="QMO_Blog_Post"><a name="blog"></a>QMO Blog Post</h3>

<p>The day before the testday, simply create a post which reminds people that a testday is happening <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The title should be similar to "REMINDER: Firefox Aurora Testday Tomorrow!"</li>
 <li>The message should summarize the activity, time, a mibbit URL to the channel, and a link to the QMO Event page for more information</li>
 <li>Be sure to thank them ahead of time for attending</li>
 <li>Be sure the "Categories" on the right are set to "QMO News"</li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good example of a <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/qmo-news/2011/03/24/testday-reminder-mozmill-crowd-and-endurance-testing/">QMO Event Reminder</a>. Your post should be syndicated to Planet within 30 minutes to an hour.</p>

<h3 id="QMO_Results_Post"><a name="results"></a>QMO Results Post</h3>

<p>The day after a testday, create another post which highlights the results.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The title should be similar to "Results of the Firefox Aurora Testday"</li>
 <li>The message should summarize the activity and the value it provided</li>
 <li>Highlight some of the results (number of bugs filed, number of bugs confirmed/verified, number of testers, etc)</li>
 <li>Identify and thank the top tester</li>
 <li>Identify and thank some of the people who were runners up for the top-tester</li>
 <li>Give general thanks to everyone who helped</li>
 <li>Provide a link to the next testday (should it be available) and ask people to come back to help</li>
 <li>Be sure the "Categories" on the right are set to "QMO News"<strong> </strong></li>
 <li><strong>Make sure you SAVE DRAFT and PREVIEW before publishing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a good example of a <a href="http://quality.mozilla.org/qmo-news/2011/04/26/results-of-the-aurora-422-testday/">QMO Results Post</a>. Your post should be syndicated to Planet within 30 minutes to an hour.  </p>
