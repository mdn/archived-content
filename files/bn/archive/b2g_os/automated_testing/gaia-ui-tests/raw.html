<p>Gaia-ui-tests is Mozilla's test suite for running end-to-end UI test cases against Gaia, the UI of Firefox OS. All the tests are written in Python with some JavaScript used for interacting with Firefox OS's APIs. This set of tutorial articles explains how to set up the environment to write and run tests.</p>
</div>

<p>Gaia-ui-tests uses <strong>Gaiatest</strong>, a Python package based around <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Marionette">Marionette</a>. Gaiatest is designed to wrap HTML locators, Marionette calls and API calls together for interoperble communication and functionality. Marionette is based on the W3C standard developed for the <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/" title="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium WebDriver</a> a programming interface for browser automation. If you have used WebDriver and page/app objects before then you will find using Marionette and gaiatest easy.</p>

<p>For those keen to get started with automated testing on Gaia/Firefox OS we have a tutorial series that will help you go from nothing to writing your own tests. Once you've completed this tutorial you'll have enough knowledge of testing, Firefox OS and Marionette to get started as a Mozilla tests contributor. It is <strong>highly</strong> recommended that you complete this tutorial if you wish to become a contributor.</p>

 <dd>A test runner is a central feature of any good test suite, allowing you to run multiple tests and report and aggregate results. In this article we will explore the basics of Python's unittest runner.</dd>

 <dd>This time around we explain how to further reduce duplication of code, by storing repeated locators in tuples and simplifying the syntax with Marionette's <code>By</code> class.</dd>

 <dd>Now the basics and behind you, and it is time to start to writing your own tests! Here we give you some tool recommendations to make the work easier, and suggest some tests to try your hand at writing.</dd>

 <dd>In its current state, our test file contains all the test runner code. This is ok for now, but as soon as you start to run many test files it will mean a lot of duplication. Here we solve this problem by abstracting the test runner code into a separate Python class.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Platform/Automated_testing/gaia-ui-tests/Part_9_app_objects">Part 9: Reducing duplication with app objects</a></dt>
 <dd>As a final improvement to the code's maintainability, in this article we explore abstracting code that handles interaction with specific Firefox OS apps out into Python app objects.</dd>
