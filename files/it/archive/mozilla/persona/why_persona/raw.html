 Persona is an openly distributed, cross-browser identity system providing a solution to the traditional password model. It addresses the usability deficiencies that plague other privacy-related systems such as OpenID, without resorting to a centralized infrastructure such as Facebook Connect.<span id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps"> </span></span></div>

Sites then must securely encrypt and store passwords to prevent the leaking of sensitive information. The prevention and negation of security leaks is the primary reason for the use of Persona, but the flexibility of its systems outclasses most standard identity security systems.</span></span></div>

<h2 id="Persona_eliminates_the_need_for_per-site_passwords">Persona eliminates the need for per-site passwords</h2>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Persona utilizes a safe, two-click system built on top of public-key cryptography for logging in to websites. The user's browser generates a cryptographic affirmation of identity that expires after a few minutes and is only valid on one site. By avoiding passwords, users do not need to worry about remembering several distinct passwords and need no longer be concerned with unsecure access to their password.<span id="result_box" lang="en"><span class="hps"> This quick and easy sign-in process eliminates the current inefficiencies of traditional account registration and allows users to quickly establish accounts on websites.</span></span></p>

    Persona's system relies on email addresses as their key component because of email's inherent versatile and private nature. The pre-existing infrastructure works very well from not only a design perspective but an ideal perspective of openly maintained and safe transfer of identity across the Internet.</div>
