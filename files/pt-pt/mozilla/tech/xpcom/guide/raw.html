<p><span class="seoSummary">These articles provide tutorials and usage documentation for XPCOM, including how to use it in your own projects and how to build XPCOM components for your Firefox add-ons and the like.</span></p>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>WebExtensions are becoming the new standard for creating add-ons. </strong>Eventually support for XPCOM add-ons will be deprecated, so you should begin to investigate porting your add-ons to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions">WebExtensions</a> API, and <a href="https://mzl.la/webext-feature-needed">report any missing functionality</a> so we can be sure to address your concerns. Work is ongoing on WebExtension capabilities, so your input will help prioritize and plan the work. To learn more about the kinds of changes that will be needed, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Comparison_with_XUL_XPCOM_extensions">Comparison with XUL/XPCOM extensions</a>. In addition, any binaries you use will then need to be converted for use with the WebExtensions <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging">native messaging</a> API, or compiled using <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/">WebAssembly</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/Emscripten">Emscripten</a>.</p>
