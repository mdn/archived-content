 <dt>Chrome process (also called the parent process)</dt>

 <dt>Content scripts</dt>
 <dd>Deprecated term for frame scripts.</dd>
 <dt>CPOWs</dt>

<dl>
 <dt>Frame scripts</dt>
 <dd>When chrome code needs to interact with web content, it factors the code that needs to access content into separate scripts, and loads them into the content process. These separate scripts are called frame scripts. We used to call these scripts "content scripts" but have deprecated that term.</dd>
 <dt>Message manager</dt>
 <dd>Message managers enable chrome code to load frame scripts into content processes, and communicate with them using a message-passing API. <a href="/en-US/docs/The_message_manager">See more about message managers</a>.</dd>
 <dt>Parent-to-child CPOWs</dt>
 <dd>CPOWs that refer to objects that live in the child (content) process.</dd>
