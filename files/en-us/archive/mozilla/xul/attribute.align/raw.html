<p>The align attribute specifies how child elements of the box are aligned, when the size of the box is larger than the total size of the children. For boxes that have horizontal orientation, it specifies how its children will be aligned vertically. For boxes that have vertical orientation, it is used to specify how its children are algined horizontally. The pack attribute is related to the alignment but is used to specify the position in the opposite direction. You can also specify the value of align using the style property <code><a href="en/CSS/-moz-box-align">-moz-box-align</a></code>.
