 <dd>Type: <em>string</em> (representing an integer)</dd>
 <dd>For elements placed directly within a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XUL/stack" title="stack">stack</a></code>, specifies the pixel position of the right edge of the element relative to the right edge of the stack. Positive values are to the left; negative values are to the right of the right edge of the stack. This location is specified with respect to the right edge of the stack prior to the element being evaluated, or added to the stack.  Placing the element which contains this attribute within the stack may result in the stack changing size.  For example, using <code>right="-80"</code> causes the stack to be enlarged 80 pixels to the right and the element's right edge to be at the same location as the right edge of the stack. In other words, the right edge of the element is placed 80 pixels to the right of where the right edge of the stack was prior to the element being added. The stack is then enlarged to include the element.</dd>
