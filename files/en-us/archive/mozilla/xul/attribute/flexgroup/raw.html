<p><font face="sans-serif">"<code>flexgroup</code>" is used to group flexible elements together and should be set to an integer. Elements with a lower flexgroup are flexed first. When those elements have reached their maximum sizes, the elements with the next higher flexgroup are flexed. This process continues until there are no more elements remaining. The same process occurs when decreasing the size, except in the other direction.</font></p>
