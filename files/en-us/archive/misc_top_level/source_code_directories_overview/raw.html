<p> </p>

<p>This document is a guide for developers to the directory structure of the Mozilla source code tree. It gives a bird's eye view of the source code so a developer can get a good idea what is in Mozilla and where to find things. It is a good document for a new Mozilla developer to start learning about the Mozilla code base.</p>

<p>This document contains material for SeaMonkey, Firefox, and Toolkit.</p>

<p>It is a living document which is (supposed to be) updated monthly according to changes in the Mozilla source tree.</p>

<h3 id="Introduction:_Common_Subdirectories" name="Introduction:_Common_Subdirectories">Introduction: Common Subdirectories</h3>

<p>A common naming scheme is used throughout the Mozilla source trees. At the top level is the name of the product (e.g. <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/">seamonkey</a>). At the second level is the name of the module (e.g. the <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/">editor</a> directory in seamonkey). The third level is where the common naming scheme usually takes over. Many third level directories contain the <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/base/">base</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/public/">public</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/idl/">idl</a> directories. Although not required, these common names are typically used for a common purpose. If files can be grouped into submodules, they are usually put in their own third level directory and given a unique name (e.g. <a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/editor/txmgr/">txmgr</a> in the editor directory in seamonkey). Beneath this third level directory, there may be fourth level base, public and idl directories. Thus, the scheme is recursive; it can apply to submodules, sub-submodules and so on.</p>

<ul>
 <li>base contains the basic (core) functionality for the module. Base contains all the source code that cannot be categorized into a submodule.</li>
 <li>build contains any special makefiles for building the particular module.</li>
 <li>doc contains any documentation associated with this module.</li>
 <li>idl contains the XPIDL (Cross Platform Interface Definition Language) interface files. Interfaces are used so functionality can be available to both Javascript scripts and C code with as little effort as possible. XPIDL files have their own mini-language and processing tools.</li>
 <li>public contains source code that will be exported to the dist/include directory. They are not all necessarily public in the general sense; some are only meant for internal use in a certain module. As more code is written with or converted to XPIDL interfaces, the value of the public directory diminishes.</li>
 <li>src contains the bulk of the source code.</li>
 <li>tests contains C harnesses, HTML or XUL that exercise this module.</li>
 <li>tools contains scripts for automatically generating certain source code and other special tools for building this module.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also platform dependent subdirectories which contain source code for specific platforms.</p>

<ul>
 <li>windows contains source code for Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0.</li>
 <li>mac contains source code for MacOS: both the PowerPC and 68000 versions.</li>

 <li>photon contains source code for <a class="external" href="http://www.qnx.com/products/photon/index.html">Photon</a>, a microkernel windowing system used in several real-time operating systems from QNX Software Systems Ltd.</li>
</ul>

It resizes and aligns pieces of content according to the CSS1 and CSS2 (cascading style sheets), alignment styles and the content itself. It does not actually render the content; it just assigns different pieces of the window to various content items. This is known as "reflowing" the content. This code is also known by the names, "NGLayout" and "Gecko."</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/lib/">lib</a> contains C code used for reference by developers in programming the Mac. It is not used. It shows how to embed the Mozilla browser in a Mac application as well as some sample file-handling code from Apple.</li>

 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/uriloader/">uriloader</a> contains C interfaces and code for invoking the correct viewer for the content contained at a certain URL. For example, if this code determines that the content is a mail message, it looks up the appropriate listener (probably Netscape Messenger) and passes the mail message to it for display. It is generic and can hand the content off to internal components (like Messenger), to plug-ins or helper apps.</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/view/">view</a> contains C interfaces and code for different types of views (e.g. scrolling view). A view contains content but does not contain the title bar, borders or other decorations (which are contained by frames). This code serves to manipulate the individual content that it contains. For example, a scrolling view will find out the scroll bar positions and tell its content where to draw according the scroll bar thumbs.</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/webshell/">webshell</a> contains C interfaces, C code, Linux shell scripts and other files for embedding Mozilla in other programs on various different platforms in various different ways (e.g. as plug-in, as ActiveX component, as XPCOM classes).</li>

XPCOM is the mechanism that allows Mozilla to export interfaces and have them automatically available to JavaScript scripts, to Microsoft COM and to regular Mozilla C code. Some low-level XPCOM classes and interfaces are also defined here (e.g. the event loop for all platforms). XPCOM is compatible and very similar to Microsoft COM (although XPCOM is cross-platform).</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/">xpfe</a> contains the C interfaces, C code and XUL for implementing the "Cross Platform Front End." Essentially, this is where the Mozilla program starts and manages other components to accomplish tasks. This code contains very little platform dependent code; it relies on other components to provide platform independent interfaces to platform specific functionality.</li>
 <li><a class="external" href="http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpinstall/">xpinstall</a> contains the C interfaces and code for implementing the SmartUpdate feature from Mozilla Classic. XPInstall provides code for downloading files, uncompressing them and installing them in a platform independent way.</li>
