<p>The new compatibility tables beta is now over and the new compatibility tables are now the default with the old compatibility tables being made obsolete.</p>

<p>See {{bug(1493417)}} for details.</p>
</div>

<p>You're probably here because you followed the beta notice link from one of our new compatibility tables. (No? Want to see the new tables? <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Be_a_beta_tester">Make yourself a beta tester.</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks for helping us test these. They're part of a much larger project. We're moving all our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">browser compatibility data into structured JSON</a>.</p>

<p>The new tables will appear on pages as the data is converted to the new format.</p>

<p>Our compat data has been moved into JSON files in the<a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data"> browser-compat-data GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>To contribute compat data you can now submit a pull request or file an issue on the repository.</p>
