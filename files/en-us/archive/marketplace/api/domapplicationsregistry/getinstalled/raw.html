<p><strong>Marketplace feature removal</strong><br>
 The functionality described on this page no longer works — Firefox Marketplace has discontinued support for Android, Desktop, Tablets, and payments (and other related functionality). For more information, read the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Marketplace/FutureofMarketplaceFAQ">Future of Marketplace FAQ</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Get a list of all installed apps from this origin. For example, if you call this on the Firefox Marketplace, you will get the list of apps installed by the Firefox Marketplace.</p>

<div class="blockIndicator note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Installable open web apps used to have a "single app per origin" security policy, but this was lifted as of Firefox 34/Firefox OS 2.1 (read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Apps/Build/installable_apps_for_Firefox_OS/App_manifest_FAQ#Can_I_have_more_than_one_app_at_my_origin.3F">this FAQ entry</a> for more information). If you still need to support older versions, consider hosting your apps at separate origins; one strategy is to <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Adding_a_subdomain">create different subdomains</a> for your apps.</p>

<pre class="brush: js; no-line-numbers">var request = window.navigator.mozApps.getInstalled();</pre>

<h3 id="Errors">Errors</h3>

<p>The string <code>ERROR</code> can be returned in <code>DOMRequest.error</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js; highlight[1]">var request = window.navigator.mozApps.getInstalled();
request.onerror = function(e) {
  alert("Error calling getInstalled: " + request.error.name);
};
request.onsuccess = function(e) {
  alert("Success, number of apps: " + request.result.length);
  var appsRecord = request.result;
};</pre>

<p>Callers are expected to set the <code>onsuccess</code> and <code>onerror</code> callback properties of the returned object, as shown in this example. If the call is successful an array of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/App"><code>App</code> objects</a> is returned in the <code>result</code> property of the returned object. In the example this is <code>request.result</code>.</p>
