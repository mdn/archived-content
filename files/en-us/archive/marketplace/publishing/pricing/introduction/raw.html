<p><strong>Marketplace feature removal</strong><br>
 The functionality described on this page no longer works — Firefox Marketplace has discontinued support for Android, Desktop, Tablets, and payments (and other related functionality).

<p class="summary">Making your apps available for a payment on Firefox Marketplace is straightforward: You setup an account with one or more payment providers, set your app's price and the countries it will be sold in and if it's an upgrade to a free app promote it as the premium version. If you also use in-app payments, you need to obtain an API key and define your in-app products. <span class="seoSummary">This section provides a guide to setting up your paid Open Web Apps and their in-app products on Firefox Marketplace, as well as providing useful additional information. </span></p>
