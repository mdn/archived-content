<h2 id="fxPay_support"><code>fxPay</code> support</h2>

<p>The fxpay library aims to eventually work in all web runtimes but the following platforms are officially supported at the moment:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/android/">Firefox for Android</a>
  <ul>
   <li>This includes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Options/Open_web_apps_for_android">web apps running as Android APKs</a></li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/">Firefox for desktop</a>

</ul>

<h3 id="Packaged_App_Restrictions">Packaged App Restrictions</h3>

<p>If you want to accept payments with fxpay in a <a href="/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps">packaged</a> app, there are a few restrictions:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Your manifest must declare an <a href="/Apps/Build/Manifest#origin">origin</a> for receipt validation.</li>
 <li>Your app must be <a href="/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps#Privileged_app">privileged</a> so that it can define an origin.</li>
 <li>Your app can only run on <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS">Firefox OS</a> 1.1 or greater because of origin support.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of this applies to <a href="/Marketplace/Options/Hosted_apps">hosted</a> apps.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_Guide">Usage Guide</h2>

<p>This section provides a full usage guide for fxpay.</p>

<h3 id="Installation">Installation</h3>

<p>To use <code>fxPay</code>, include a copy of the JavaScript library locally in your web application. Using the <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> package manager, this command would install the library into your app:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">bower install fxpay</pre>

<p>You could then link to the library in your app's HTML using a script tag:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;script src="bower_components/fxpay/lib/fxpay.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Alternatively you can use <a href="http://bower.io/docs/tools/">Bower tools</a> to load and/or compress your managed scripts.</p>

<h3 id="Source_Distribution">Source Distribution</h3>

<p>You can download the latest stable source via <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fxpay/releases">fxpay's Git repository</a>. </p>

<h3 id="Using_UMD_or_RequireJS">Using UMD or RequireJS</h3>

<p>The <code>fxpay</code> JavaScript distribution is exposed using the <a href="http://bob.yexley.net/umd-javascript-that-runs-anywhere/">Universal Module Definition (UMD)</a> format and is also <a href="http://requirejs.org">RequireJS</a> compatible.</p>

<h3 id="Set_Up_Your_Products">Set Up Your Products</h3>

<p>Log into the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub</a> and upload your app following the submission process. On the <strong>Compatability &amp; Payments</strong> page under <strong>Prices &amp; Countries</strong> set in-app payments to <strong>Yes</strong> and save the change. Now open the <strong>In-App Payments</strong> page and click <strong>Configure In-App Products</strong>, which opens the <strong>In-App Products</strong> page where you can create and edit your in-app products. For more information on using this page, see <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Publishing/Pricing/In-app_products">In-App Products</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to test out <code>fxpay</code> before setting up your products, skip to the <a href="#fake-products">Working with Fake Products</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="Fetching_Products">Fetching Products</h3>

<p>Call <code>fxpay.getProducts()</code> to retrieve all of the active products you set up in the Developer Hub:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.getProducts()
  .then(function(products) {
    products.forEach(function(product) {
      console.log('product ID:', product.productId);
      console.log('product name:', product.name);
    });
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Error getting products: ' + error);
  });
</pre>

<p>The <code>getProducts()</code> <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/promise" title="The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value."><code>promise</code></a> is resolved with an array of <a href="#product-info">product info</a> objects and rejected with an <a href="#errors">error</a> object. You can call this method to show a list of products so the user can purchase them.</p>

<h3 id="Working_with_Fake_Products"><a name="fake-products">Working with Fake Products</a></h3>

<p>To test in-app purchases without first configuring products on the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub</a>, you can work with fake products. Set this somewhere in your app's initialization:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.configure({fakeProducts: true});</pre>

<p>This changes <code>fxpay.getProducts()</code> to return pre-defined products that can only be purchased in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments_section/mozPay_iap#Simulating_payments">simulation</a> mode. The products will have fixed ID strings, names, and price points but this should help you set up your fulfillment code.</p>

<p>When you have submitted your finished app and fully configured your products, set <code>fakeProducts</code> to false and the same call to<code> </code><code>fxpay.getProducts()</code> will retrieve your app's real products.</p>

<h3 id="Purchasing_A_Product">Purchasing A Product</h3>

<p>You can call <code>fxpay.purchase()</code> to start the buy flow for an item. First, you'll probably want to make a screen where you offer some products for purchase using <code>fxpay.getProducts()</code>. Here's how to create a buy button that calls <code>fxpay.purchase()</code> when tapped:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.getProducts()
  .then(function(products) {
    products.forEach(function(product) {

      var button = document.createElement('button');
      button.textContent = 'Buy ' + product.name;
      button.addEventListener('click', function () {

        fxpay.purchase(product.productId)
          .then(function(purchasedProduct) {
            console.log('product purchased! ',
                        purchasedProduct.productId);
            // It is now safe to deliver the product.
          })
          .catch(function(error) {
            console.error('error purchasing: ' + error);
          });

      });
      document.body.appendChild(button);
    });
  });
</pre>

<p>The <code>purchase()</code> <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/promise" title="The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value."><code>promise</code></a> resolves with a <a href="#product-info">product info</a> object and is rejected with an <a href="#errors">error</a> object. The promise resolves only after the user completes the buy flow <em>and</em> the Marketplace server has verified the receipt so at this time it is safe to deliver the item.</p>

<p>How does this work? The <code>fxpay.purchase()</code> function automates the process of opening a payment window, completing the transaction, then waiting for and verifying an incoming JWT. If you want to know the specifics, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/In-app_payments">mozPay in-app payments guide</a> but that's not mandatory for using the <code>fxpay</code> library.</p>

<h3 id="Restoring_Products_From_Receipt">Restoring Products From Receipt</h3>

<p><code>fxpay</code> will discover any <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/WebApplicationReceipt">receipts</a> already installed on the user's device. If a receipt is valid then the user has already purchased the product so you should make it available for use. You can check for receipts and validate them while fetching products like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.getProducts()
  .then(function(products) {
    products.forEach(function(product) {

      if (product.hasReceipt()) {
        product.validateReceipt()
          .then(function(restoredProduct) {
            console.log('restored product from receipt:',
                        restoredProduct.productId);
          })
          .catch(function(error) {
            console.error('Error validating receipt: ' + error);
          });
      } else {
        // Show a buy button for the product.
      }

    });
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="Persisting_Purchase_Receipts">Persisting Purchase Receipts</h3>

<p>When <code>fxpay.purchase()</code> resolves, a receipt is installed on the user's device and backed up in the Firefox Marketplace database. <code>FxPay</code> does not offer a feature for restoring receipts on new devices yet but you could capture a receipt for later restoration like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.purchase(product.productId)
  .then(function(purchasedProduct) {
    console.log('purchase receipt:',
                purchasedProduct.receiptInfo.receipt);
    // Ask the user to log in then save the base 64
    // encoded receipt string to your server with
    // their user ID.
  });
</pre>

<p>When fxpay <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1045228">supports receipt restoration</a>, all historic purchase receipts will be made available.</p>

<h3 id="Validating_an_app_receipt">Validating an app receipt</h3>

<p>Although this is not directly involved with in-app purchases, it is worth knowing that fxpay provides a mechanism to check the receipt of a paid app when it is loaded on the user's device. This is done with the <code>validateAppReceipt()</code> method, as seen below:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.validateAppReceipt()
  .then(function(productInfo) {
    console.log('receipt is valid; app was purchased');
    console.log('product URL:', productInfo.productUrl);
  })
  .catch(function(reason) {
    console.log('receipt is INVALID; reason:',
                reason.error || reason);
  });</pre>

<p>If a valid app receipt is found, the promise resolves with a productInfo object that allows you to retrieve further info about the installed app. If not the promise rejects with a rejection reason (an object or a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMString" title="DOMString is a UTF-16 String. As JavaScript already uses such strings, DOMString is mapped directly to a String."><code>DOMString</code></a>).</p>

<div>
<p>To see the code above in context, look at our <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fxpay/blob/master/example/hosted-paid-app/media/js/index.js#L43">fxpay example</a> on Github. If you want to run the example app, follow the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fxpay/tree/master/example/hosted-paid-app">installation instructions</a>. Some further notes:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The <code>allowTestReceipts</code> option is a useful configuration option for using test receipts to test that your code is validating receipts correctly (see <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/Validating_a_receipt#Test_receipts">Test Receipts</a> for more information.) You should make sure to turn this off in production, otherwise people can use your app for free with test receipts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fxpay_reference">fxpay reference</h2>

<p>This section provides a reference to important objects contained in the fxpay code, and other available features.</p>

<h3 id="Product_Info_Object"><a name="product-info">Product Info Object</a></h3>

<p>Many different promises resolve with a product info object. <a href="#errors">Error</a> objects also have a <code>productInfo</code> property which points to such an object. The product info object has the following properties:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><em>product.productId</em></dt>
 <dd>A unique string identifier for the product. This corresponds to the identifier you see in the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/developers/">Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub</a> when managing your products.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.name</em></dt>
 <dd>The name of the product in the default locale.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.productUrl</em></dt>
 <dd>The URL of the product as declared in the receipt. This will most likely be a URL to the app, such as <code>https://your-hosted-app</code> or <code>app://your-packaged-app</code>.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.smallImageUrl</em></dt>
 <dd>A 64 pixel square image URL for the product.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.pricePointId</em></dt>
 <dd>A reference to the <a href="/en-US/Marketplace/Monetization/App_pricing">price point</a> chosen during product configuration.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.receiptInfo</em></dt>
 <dd>If the product has been purchased, this object gives you more information about the receipt. If the product has not been purchased the property will be falsey.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.receiptInfo.status</em></dt>
 <dd>A string status of the receipt, as returned by the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/WebApplicationReceipt#Verification_of_a_Receipt">validation service</a>. Possible values: "ok", "pending", "refunded", "expired" or "invalid."</dd>
 <dt><em>product.receiptInfo.reason</em></dt>
 <dd>For invalid receipts only, this string indicates the reason it was invalid.</dd>
 <dt><em>product.receiptInfo.receipt</em></dt>
 <dd>The original <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps/WebApplicationReceipt">web application receipt</a> string. You can cache this in your application to manage restoration of user purchases yourself.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Errors"><a name="errors">Errors</a></h3>

<p>Promises are rejected with class-like objects that are subclasses of <code>Error</code>.  The following is a guide to the hierarchy of errors so you can catch them and react accordingly. Most errors will also have a <code>productInfo</code> property which points to a relevant <a href="#product-info">product info</a> object.</p>

<p>Here's an example of ignoring cancelled payments and reacting to payment failures:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.getProducts()
  .then(function(products) {
    // ...
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    console.error('Error: ' + error);

    if (error instanceof fxpay.errors.PayWindowClosedByUser) {
      console.info('user cancelled the payment');
    } else if (error instanceof fxpay.errors.PaymentFailed) {
      // Maybe show some info on how to purchase.
    } else {
      throw error;
    }

  });
</pre>

<h3 id="Logging">Logging</h3>

<p>By default, <code>fxpay</code> logs everything using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/console">window.console</a>. If you want to replace <code>console</code> with your own logger, pass in an object as <code>log</code> that implements the same <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/console">window.console</a> methods:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.configure({log: myConsole});
</pre>

<h3 id="Configuration"><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h3>

<p>You can call <code>fxpay.configure(overrides)</code> to set some internal variables. If you call this repeatedly, the old keys will be preserved unless overidden.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">fxpay.configure({apiTimeoutMs: 3000});
</pre>

<p>Possible overrides:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><em>apiUrlBase</em></dt>
 <dd>The base URL of the internal <code>fxpay</code> API. Default: <code><a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com">https://marketplace.firefox.com</a></code>.</dd>
 <dt><em>apiTimeoutMs</em></dt>
 <dd>A length of time in milleseconds until any API request will time out. Default: 10000.</dd>
 <dt><em>apiVersionPrefix</em></dt>
 <dd>A Path that gets appended to <code>apiUrlBase</code> to access the right API version. Default: <code>/api/v1</code>.</dd>
 <dt><em>fakeProducts</em></dt>
 <dd>If true, <code>fxpay.getProducts()</code> will return fake products that can be used for testing. See <a href="#fake-products">fake products</a> for details. Default: <code>false</code>.</dd>
 <dt><em>log</em></dt>
 <dd>A log object compatible with <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/console">window.console</a> to use internally. Default: <code>window.console</code>.</dd>
 <dt><em>receiptCheckSites</em></dt>
 <dd>Array of sites allowed to verify purchase receipts. These values are top level URLs to verifier services; they don't need to include URL paths. You would only need to adjust this if you want to work with something other than the production version of Firefox Marketplace. Default: <code>['https://receiptcheck.marketplace.firefox.com']</code>.</dd>
