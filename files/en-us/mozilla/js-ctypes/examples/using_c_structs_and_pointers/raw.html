The DLL/SO/etc file you make must be shipped with your add-on. Standard libraries offer the advantage of not having to ship anything. They are already available on the operating system for you.

<p>In this example, we show how to use C structs and pointers with js-ctypes.</p>

<h4 id="Declaring_a_js-ctypes_struct_matching_a_C_struct">Declaring a js-ctypes struct matching a C struct</h4>

<p>If we have a C structure like this:</p>

<pre><span class="cm">struct st_t</span>
<span class="cm">{</span>
<span class="cm">  void   *self;</span>
<span class="cm">  char   *str;</span>
<span class="cm">  size_t  buff_size;</span>
<span class="cm">  int     i;</span>
<span class="cm">  float   f;</span>
<span class="cm">  char    c;</span>
<span class="cm">};</span></pre>

<p>we can use it in JavaScript by writing something like this:</p>

<pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">st_t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">StructType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"st_t"</span><span class="p">,</span>
                      <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"self"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PointerType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">void_t</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">},</span>
                        <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"str"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PointerType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">char</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">},</span>
                        <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"buff_size"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">size_t</span> <span class="p">},</span>
                        <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"i"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">int</span> <span class="p">},</span>
                        <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"f"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">float</span> <span class="p">},</span>
                        <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s2">"c"</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">char</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">]);</span></pre>

<p>Here we are using the <code>StructType()</code> factory method of the ctypes object to create a <code>CType</code> object that represents the C struct named <code>st_t</code>.  The first parameter of this method is the name of the type, which corresponds to the name of the C struct.  The second parameter is an array of field descriptors.  Each field descriptor contains the name and field type of the corresponding field of the C struct.  The call to <code>StructType()</code> returns a <code>CType</code> object, and we then apply the <code>new</code> operator to it to create a specific instance of this newly defined type - a JavaScript representation of the C struct.</p>

<h4 id="Using_C_strings_with_js-ctypes">Using C strings with js-ctypes</h4>

<p>A pointer to char in JavaScript is declared as follows:</p>

<pre>var str = <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">PointerType</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">char</span><span class="p">)</span>;</pre>

<p>Now imagine you call a C function that returns a C string and you want to modify the contents of this string. In the js-ctypes context, you can only operate on buffers of known capacity. Therefore, the size of the buffer must be specified. Additionally, the js-ctypes pointer must be casted to reflect the size of the buffer:</p>

<pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ptr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cast</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">str</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ArrayType</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">ctypes</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">char</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">buff_size</span> <span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">ptr</span> <span class="p">);</span></pre>

<p>Here buff_size is of type ctypes.size_t.</p>

<p>Once we have a ctypes char pointer that points to a buffer of known size, we modiify the contents of the memory block as follows:</p>

<div class="codehilite">
<pre><span class="nx">ptr</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contents</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello world from JavaScript!!!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>String() adds the '\0' character.</p>
