<ul>
 <li>User-set alias, stored locally (set when the user renames someone from Instantbird/<a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>)</li>
 <li>Server-stored alias (some protocol store the aliases online)</li>
 <li>Display name / Friendly name (set by the remote contact, stored on the server)</li>
 <li>Username, the unique identifier of the buddy for this protocol. Can be numbers (e.g. ICQ, QQ), email addresses (e.g. MSN, XMPP) or some other string.</li>
</ul>

<p>Possible storage locations:</p>

<ul>
 <li>mozStorage (the file blist.sqlite)</li>
 <li>purplexpcom (cached copy)</li>
 <li>libpurple (cached copy)</li>
 <li>server read/write (server-stored alias)</li>
