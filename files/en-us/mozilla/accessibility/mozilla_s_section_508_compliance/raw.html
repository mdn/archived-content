  <p>The United States Federal Rehabilitation Act's Section 508 is a new standard for defining accessibility requirements for software and other electronic and information technology. <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&amp;ID=12#Software">Part of Section 508 (§1194.21) specifically relates to Mozilla</a>, and the ability of US government agencies to buy software that contains Mozilla software components.</p>

        <td colspan="2"><em>Mostly complete</em>.<br>
          <br>
          Caveats: 1) Although sidebar cannot be customized without a mouse, all sidebar functions that come with the browser are available through other means 2) Java and in-page plugins cannot be used with the keyboard, so they must not be installed for keyboard-only users<br>
          <br>
          Additional features for the keyboard: 1) <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/access/type-ahead/">Find as you type</a> allows for quick navigation to links and convenient text searching 2) Browse with caret (<kbd>F7</kbd> key toggles) allows users to select arbitrary content with the keyboard and move through content as if inside a readonly editor.</td>
        <td><em>Incomplete</em>. Inadequate attention paid to Mac keyboard bugs. Needs more investigation.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(b) Applications shall not disrupt or disable activated features of other products that are identified as accessibility features, where those features are developed and documented according to industry standards. Applications also shall not disrupt or disable activated features of any operating system that are identified as accessibility features where the application programming interface for those accessibility features has been documented by the manufacturer of the operating system and is available to the product developer.</td>

        <td>(c) A well-defined on-screen indication of the current focus shall be provided that moves among interactive interface elements as the input focus changes. The focus shall be programmatically exposed so that assistive technology can track focus and focus changes.</td>
        <td colspan="2"><em>Complete</em>. We expose focus programmatically via MSAA (Windows) and ATK (Linux/UNIX).</td>
        <td><em>Incomplete</em>, we show focus but need to expose it programmatically by supporting Carbon/Cocoa accessibility.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(d) Sufficient information about a user interface element including the identity, operation and state of the element shall be available to assistive technology. When an image represents a program element, the information conveyed by the image must also be available in text.</td>
        <td colspan="2"><em>Complete</em>. We expose this information to assistive technology via <dfn>Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)</dfn> (Windows) and <dfn>Accessibility Toolkit (ATK)</dfn> (Linux/UNIX).</td>
        <td><em>Incomplete</em>. No development efforts have made made to utilize Cocoa or Carbon accessibility APIs.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(e) When bitmap images are used to identify controls, status indicators, or other programmatic elements, the meaning assigned to those images shall be consistent throughout an application's performance.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>(g) Applications shall not override user selected contrast and color selections and other individual display attributes.</td>
        <td><em>Complete</em>. The default theme, Classic, uses the operating system's font and color contrast settings. When the Windows "high contrast theme" is used Classic, and thus the system look and feel, is automatically selected.</td>
        <td><em>Complete when run in the Gnome desktop</em>. The default theme, Classic, uses Gnome's font and color contrast settings. Under Linux/UNIX it is the user's choice, whether to stick with the Gnome theme or not -- they must choose Classic if they want to follow the Gnome theme.</td>
        <td><em>Unknown - needs research</em></td>

      <tr>
        <td>(h) When animation is displayed, the information shall be displayable in at least one non-animated presentation mode at the option of the user.</td>
        <td colspan="3"><em>Complete</em>. Mozilla's preferences under Privacy &amp; Security - Images contain options for making animated images still.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(i) Color coding shall not be used as the only means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.</td>
        <td colspan="3"><em>Complete</em>. Caveat: normally Mozilla uses a color change to indicate when a link has been visited. However, the visited link appearance can be altered via a user style sheet.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(j) When a product permits a user to adjust color and contrast settings, a variety of color selections capable of producing a range of contrast levels shall be provided.</td>
        <td colspan="3"><em>Complete</em>. Mozilla's appearance preferences panel contains a large number of color possibilities.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>(k) Software shall not use flashing or blinking text, objects, or other elements having a flash or blink frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz.</td>
        <td colspan="3"><em>Complete</em>. Mozilla supports of &lt;blink&gt; and text-decoration: blink in web pages. In these situations Mozilla blinks 1 Hz, which is within the allowable range and follows the stricter MIL-STD standard.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>(l) When electronic forms are used, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues.</td>
        <td colspan="3"><em>Partially complete</em>. See functional performance criteria below. Screen reader access is currently being tested. An extension called Ad Block helps remove extra noisy content from web pages that clutter accessibility.</td>

        <td><em>Complete</em>. Built-in text zoom limited only to the size of the window. Works ZoomText version 8.11. Caveat, the document reading and app readings modes don't support columnized text. The focus is not always correctly echoed via text to speech. However, it is functional and very possible to use ZoomText with Mozilla in this mode. Have contacted AI Squared to work on reamining issues.</td>
