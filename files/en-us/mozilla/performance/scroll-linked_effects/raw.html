<p class="summary">The definition of a scroll-linked effect is an effect implemented on a webpage where something changes based on the scroll position, for example updating a positioning property with the aim of producing a parallax scrolling effect. This article discusses scroll-linked effects, their effect on performance, related tools, and possible mitigation techniques.</p>

<h2 id="Scrolling_effects_explained">Scrolling effects explained</h2>

<p>Often scrolling effects are implemented by listening for the {{event("scroll")}} event and then updating elements on the page in some way (usually the CSS {{cssxref("position")}} or {{cssxref("transform")}} property.) You can find a sampling of such effects at <a href="https://github.com/RByers/css-houdini-drafts/blob/master/css-scroll-api/UseCases.md">CSS Scroll API: Use Cases</a>.</p>

<p>These effects work well in browsers where the scrolling is done synchronously on the browser's main thread. However, most browsers now support some sort of asynchronous scrolling in order to provide a consistent 60 frames per second experience to the user. In the asynchronous scrolling model, the visual scroll position is updated in the compositor thread and is visible to the user before the {{event("scroll")}} event is updated in the DOM and fired on the main thread. This means that the effects implemented will lag a little bit behind what the user sees the scroll position to be. This can cause the effect to be laggy, janky, or jittery — in short, something we want to avoid.</p>

<p>Below are a couple of examples of effects that would not work well with asynchronous scrolling, along with equivalent versions that would work well:</p>

<h3 id="Example_1_Sticky_positioning">Example 1: Sticky positioning</h3>

<p>Here is an implementation of a sticky-positioning effect, where the "toolbar" div will stick to the top of the screen as you scroll down.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;body style="height: 5000px" onscroll="document.getElementById('toolbar').style.top = Math.max(100, window.scrollY) + 'px'"&gt;
 &lt;div id="toolbar" style="position: absolute; top: 100px; width: 100px; height: 20px; background-color: green"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

<p>This implementation of sticky positioning relies on the scroll event listener to reposition the "toolbar" div. As the scroll event listener runs in the JavaScript on the browser's main thread, it will be asynchronous relative to the user-visible scrolling. Therefore, with asynchronous scrolling, the event handler will be delayed relative to the user-visible scroll, and so the div will not stay visually fixed as intended. Instead, it will move with the user's scrolling, and then "snap" back into position when the scroll event handler runs. This constant moving and snapping will result in a jittery visual effect. One way to implement this without the scroll event listener is to use the CSS property designed for this purpose:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;body style="height: 5000px"&gt;
 &lt;div id="toolbar" style="position: sticky; top: 0px; margin-top: 100px; width: 100px; height: 20px; background-color: green"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

<p>This version works well with asynchronous scrolling because position of the "toolbar" div is updated by the browser as the user scrolls.</p>

<h3 id="Example_2_Scroll_snapping">Example 2: Scroll snapping</h3>

<p>Below is an implementation of scroll snapping, where the scroll position snaps to a particular destination when the user's scrolling stops near that destination.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;body style="height: 5000px"&gt;
 &lt;script&gt;
    function snap(destination) {
        if (Math.abs(destination - window.scrollY) &lt; 3) {
            scrollTo(window.scrollX, destination);
        } else if (Math.abs(destination - window.scrollY) &lt; 200) {
            scrollTo(window.scrollX, window.scrollY + ((destination - window.scrollY) / 2));
            setTimeout(snap, 20, destination);
        }
    }
    var timeoutId = null;
    addEventListener("scroll", function() {
        if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        timeoutId = setTimeout(snap, 200, parseInt(document.getElementById('snaptarget').style.top));
    }, true);
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;div id="snaptarget" class="snaptarget" style="position: relative; top: 200px; width: 100%; height: 200px; background-color: green"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

<p>In this example, there is a scroll event listener which detects if the scroll position is within 200 pixels of the top of the "snaptarget" div. If it is, then it triggers an animation to "snap" the scroll position to the top of the div. As this animation is driven by JavaScript on the browser's main thread, it can be interrupted by other JavaScript running in other tabs or other windows. Therefore, the animation can end up looking janky and not as smooth as intended. Instead, using the CSS snap-points property will allow the browser to run the animation asynchronously, providing a smooth visual effect to the user.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;body style="height: 5000px"&gt;
 &lt;style&gt;
    body, /* blink currently has bug that requires declaration on `body` */
    html {
      scroll-snap-type: y proximity;
    }
    .snaptarget {
      scroll-snap-align: start;
      position: relative;
      top: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      background-color: green;
    }
 &lt;/style&gt;
 &lt;div class="snaptarget"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;</pre>

<p>This version can work smoothly in the browser even if there is slow-running Javascript on the browser's main thread.</p>

<h3 id="Other_effects">Other effects</h3>

<p>In many cases, scroll-linked effects can be reimplemented using CSS and made to run on the compositor thread. However, in some cases the current APIs offered by the browser do not allow this. In all cases, however, Firefox will display a warning to the developer console (starting in version 46) if it detects the presence of a scroll-linked effect on a page. Pages that use scrolling effects without listening for scroll events in JavaScript will not get this warning. See the <a href="https://staktrace.com/spout/entry.php?id=834">Asynchronous scrolling in Firefox</a> blog post for some more examples of effects that can be implemented using CSS to avoid jank.</p>

<h2 id="Future_improvements">Future improvements</h2>

<p>Going forward, we would like to support more effects in the compositor. In order to do so, we need you (yes, you!) to tell us more about the kinds of scroll-linked effects you are trying to implement, so that we can find good ways to support them in the compositor. Currently there are a few proposals for APIs that would allow such effects, and they all have their advantages and disadvantages. The proposals currently under consideration are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/">Web Animations</a>: A new API for precisely controlling web animations in JavaScript, with an <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Layout/Extended_Timelines">additional proposal</a> to map scroll position to time and use that as a timeline for the animation.</li>
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18GGuTRGnafai17PDWjCHHAvFRsCfYUDYsi720sVPkws/edit?pli=1#heading=h.iy9r1phg1ux4">CompositorWorker</a>: Allows JavaScript to be run on the compositor thread in small chunks, provided it doesn't cause the framerate to drop.</li>
 <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VnvAqeWFG9JFZfgG5evBqrLGDZYRE5w6G5jEDORekPY/edit?pli=1">Scroll Customization</a>: Introduces a new API for content to dictate how a scroll delta is applied and consumed. As of this writing, Mozilla does not plan to support this proposal, but it is included for completeness.</li>
</ul>
