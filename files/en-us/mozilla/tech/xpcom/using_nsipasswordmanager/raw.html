<div class="note">
 <p>I just had to use the Password Manager for a project I was working on, so I thought I'd braindump my notes to the wiki while I was at it. This code is tested, but barely, and I am by no means an expert on this area. Review and cleanup would be appreciated. <a href="/User:Zachlipton" title="User:Zachlipton">Zachlipton</a> 22:52, 18 July 2006 (PDT)</p>

<p>The code on this page will work with applications using Toolkit 1.8 and below such as Firefox 2.0.0.x and Thunderbird 2.0.0.x. For similar functionality in Toolkit 1.9, see <a href="/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/Using_nsILoginManager" title="en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/Using_nsILoginManager">Using nsILoginManager</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Working_with_Password_Manager" name="Working_with_Password_Manager">Working with Password Manager</h3>
<p>Extensions often need to securely store passwords to external sites, web applications, and so on. To do so securely, they can use <code><a href="/en/nsIPasswordManager" title="en/nsIPasswordManager">nsIPasswordManager</a></code>, which provides for secure storage of sensitive password information.</p>
<h3 id="Getting_nsIPasswordManager" name="Getting_nsIPasswordManager">Getting <code>nsIPasswordManager</code></h3>
<p>To get a component implementing <code>nsIPasswordManager</code>, use the following:</p>
<pre>var passwordManager = Components.classes["@mozilla.org/passwordmanager;1"]
                                .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPasswordManager);
</pre>
<h3 id="Storing_a_password" name="Storing_a_password">Storing a password</h3>
<p>To store a password in the password manager, you need three things: a hostname/URL (you'll need this to retrieve the password again later), a username, and a password. Of this information, the password is the only data that will be stored securely. Adding a password to the password manager is easy:</p>
<pre class="eval">passwordManager.addUser('host', 'username', 'password');
</pre>
<p>Since there's no provision to include names of HTML input fields, no password stored by this interface will be used to fill in passwords on web pages. <a href="/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsILoginManager" title="en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsILoginManager">nsILoginManager</a>, available in Toolkit 1.9, does let you include input field names.</p>
<h3 id="Retrieving_a_password" name="Retrieving_a_password">Retrieving a password</h3>
<p>Retrieving a password from the password manager is more difficult. The example below should serve as a starting point:</p>
<pre>// the host name of the password we are looking for
var queryString = 'http://www.example.com';
// ask the password manager for an enumerator:
var e = passwordManager.enumerator;
// step through each password in the password manager until we find the one we want:
while (e.hasMoreElements()) {
    try {
        // get an nsIPassword object out of the password manager.
        // This contains the actual password...
        var pass = e.getNext().QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIPassword);
        if (pass.host == queryString) {
             // found it!
             alert(pass.user); // the username
             alert(pass.password); // the password
             break;
        }
    } catch (ex) {
        // do something if decrypting the password failed--probably a continue
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Note that the user will be prompted for their master password if they have chosen to set one to secure their passwords.</p>
<h3 id="Removing_a_password" name="Removing_a_password">Removing a password</h3>
<pre>passwordManager.removeUser('host','username');
