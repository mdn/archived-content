<p>This method was introduced in <a href="/en/Firefox_3_for_developers" title="en/Firefox_3_for_developers">Firefox 3</a> and is used for obtaining a weak reference for an object. To obtain the object reference, you have to call <code>get()</code> on the resulting object.</p>

<p>In addition, just because <code>get()</code> succeeds doesn't mean your object is valid. It might simply not have been garbage collected yet. You might have to check other aspects of the object (like <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/parentNode" title="The Node.parentNode read-only property returns the parent of the specified node in the DOM tree."><code>Node.parentNode()</code></a> on a DOM node) to verify the object is truly what you want.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In <span title="(Firefox 11.0 / Thunderbird 11.0 / SeaMonkey 2.8)">Gecko 11.0</span>, this method was changed to throw an exception if <code>obj</code> is <code>null</code>. In <span title="(Firefox 12.0 / Thunderbird 12.0 / SeaMonkey 2.9)">Gecko 12.0</span>, the previous behavior of silently failing has been restored.</p>

<h3 id="Example">Example</h3>

<p>In this example here, a weak reference to a window is held. And then later on it is matched in the array and used.</p>

<pre>var arr = [];

arr.push(Cu.getWeakReference(window));

//now lets say this code runs in another block:
for (var i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++) {
  if (arr[i].get() == window) {
    //found the window
    break;
  }
}</pre>
