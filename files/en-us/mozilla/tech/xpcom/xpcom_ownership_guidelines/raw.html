<p>...naturally. If you create a temporary object, obviously it's up to you to destroy it. That's a sure sign of ownership. If you create an object with a longer lifespan, you will own it until you give ownership away.</p>

<p>All "factory" and "getter" functions produce owning pointers.</p>

<p>Such a function is the perfect example of something that creates an object with a longer lifespan that itself, and gives away ownership (by producing a pointer that is already <code>AddRef</code>ed) --- in this case, to the caller. This is terrific for factory functions, but can be problematic for mere getters. It's unfortunate if you just needed access to it for a moment. In the latter case, caching the pointer you got back makes you a de facto owner. This may not be appropriate; and it may be hard to remedy without knowing if the object in question was truly created in response to your query.</p>

<p>You don't own an object because <strong>you</strong> need <strong>it</strong>. In fact often you own it because <strong>it</strong> needs <strong>you</strong>.</p>

<p>Even transitively. Or put another way: the ownership graph for any system should be acyclic. Anytime there is a cycle of ownership, there is a situation that isn't automatically handled by destructors. Special code must be provided and called to break the cycle before the participants can be individually released.</p>

<p>As for instance, when it owns you.</p>

<p>Though parents may not <strong>need</strong> to own their children. For instance, a tree may own all the nodes that are in it. All the nodes in the tree point to each other with non-owning pointers. In the simplest scheme, however, parents point to their children with owning-pointers, children point back to their parents with non-owning-pointers.</p>

<h3 id="Containers_own_the_things_they_contain_.28and_not_the_reverse.29." name="Containers_own_the_things_they_contain_.28and_not_the_reverse.29.">Containers own the things they contain (and not the reverse).</h3>

<h3 id="Use_nsCOMPtrs_to_implement_owning-pointers." name="Use_nsCOMPtrs_to_implement_owning-pointers.">Use <code>nsCOMPtr</code>s to implement owning-pointers.</h3>

<p>It's explicit, efficient, and fairly bullet-proof. It's easier to write `getter's and `setter's; and you don't need to put anything in your destructor.</p>
