<p>{{ Fx_minversion_header(3) }}</p>

<p>Frecency is a score given to each unique URI in Places, encompassing bookmarks, history and tags. This score is determined by the amount of revisitation, the type of those visits, how recent they were, and whether the URI was bookmarked or tagged.</p>

<p>The word "frecency" itself is a combination of the words "frequency" and "recency."</p>

<ul>
 <li>The default frecency value for all valid entries is -1. Places with this value can show up in autocomplete results.</li>
 <li>Invalid places have a frecency value of zero, and will not show up in autocomplete results. Examples of invalid places are "place:" queries, and unvisited livemark feed entries.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Example" name="Example">Example</h3>

<p>This is an example of a frecency calculation for a URI that is bookmarked and has been visited twice recently (once yesterday, and once last week by clicking a link), and two other times more than 90 days ago:</p>

 <li class="noinclude">The initial algorithm design was by Mike Connor and Seth Spitzer.</li>
 <li class="noinclude">The initial implementation was done by Seth and Dietrich Ayala.</li>
 <li class="noinclude">Further features and refinement by Ed Lee (implemented adaptive matching and most of the character restrictors), Marco Bonardo and Shawn Wilsher.</li>
 <li class="noinclude">The latter two later ported all of the code from C++ to JavaScript.</li>
