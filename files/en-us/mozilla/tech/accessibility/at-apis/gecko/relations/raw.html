 <dt id="RELATION_LABELLED_BY">RELATION_LABELLED_BY</dt>
 <dd>This object is labelled by a target object. If the accessible has an name you can get the <a href="/en/nsIAccessible" title="en/nsIAccessible">nsIAccessible</a> that it was labelled by in order to get more formatting information. Note that the label and description (see RELATION_DESCRIBED_BY) relations may be used to prevent redundant information from being presented by the screen reader, since the label and description can occur both on their own, and in the name or description fields of an <a href="/en/nsIAccessible" title="en/nsIAccessible">nsIAccessible</a>.</dd>
