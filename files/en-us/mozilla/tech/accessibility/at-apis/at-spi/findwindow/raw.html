<p>In XUL-based clients, screen readers may need to find the content window so that they know where to start grabbing the AT-SPI tree, in order to load the current document into a buffer in their own process.
</p><p>Use <a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/access/unix/atspi-support#relation_embeds">RELATION_EMBEDS</a> on the ROLE_FRAME, which is at the root of each top level window. This will point to the root content accessible(s) for that XUL window.
</p><p>When you see the content window receive focus, first check the role. If it is a ROLE_DOCUMENT_FRAME then this should be treated as a document for the default modality of the screen reader. If it is a ROLE_EMBEDDED, ROLE_DIALOG or ROLE_ALERT then stay in focus tracking mode -- there is no need to parse the document. In addition, if it is a ROLE_ALERT, a screen reader should treat it as a message box -- that is, to read the entire contents. These roles can occur on content because of the new <a class="external" href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessible_DHTML">Accessible DHTML technology</a> which allows the author to specify the type of document or container.
</p><p>Gecko also helps determine when to load a new window by firing the following document events: document:load-complete, document:reload and document:load-stopped
