<p>Although XSLT 2.0 is not natively supported in Firefox, it is possible via <a class="external" href="http://saxonica.com">Saxon-B</a> (Java) or, more recently, <a class="external" href="http://www.saxonica.com/documentation/index.html#!about/whatis" title="http://www.saxonica.com/ce/doc/about/intro.xml">Saxon-CE </a>(JavaScript) to perform <a class="external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/">XSLT 2.0</a>.  </p>

<p>Saxon-CE</p>

<p>No extensions are required, Saxon-CE runs whenever a HTML page is loaded that links to the Saxon-CE JavaScript library.</p>

<p>Saxon-B</p>

<p>The <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5023">XSL Results</a> extension uses the new incarnation of LiveConnect (handled by Java 1.6v12+ instead of Mozilla-specific code) to connect with the Java-based Saxon-B library, and adds support for having XSLT performed automatically when visiting a page with the appropriate XSLT processing instruction (and which isn't processed by Firefox's own XSLT 1.0 processor).</p>

<p>Saxon-CE</p>

<p>A JavaScript API is provided for initiating an XSLT 2.0 transform from a web page. Error and diagnostics output from Saxon-CE can be reviewed in the Firefox developer console or in Firebug.</p>

<p>Saxon-B</p>

<p>The extension demonstrates how one can use LiveConnect code to communicate with the Saxon-B library, but one might find the JavaScript code module approach used inside the extension <a class="link-https" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5515" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5515">XqUSEme</a> as a more reusable approach.</p>

<p>The code does not currently work on the Mac (except for server edition supporting Java 1.6) due to its lagging Java support (and thus LiveConnect support).</p>
