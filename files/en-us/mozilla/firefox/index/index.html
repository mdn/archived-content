For example, if you call the <a href="/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox/Message_Manager/Message_manager_overview#Global_frame_message_manager">global frame message manager</a>&apos;s <code>loadFrameScript()</code> function, then the script will be loaded separately into all open tabs.

Firefox has a flexible GUI toolkit called XUL that allows GUI elements to be declared and laid out declaratively, similar to web content. Just like web content, the Firefox UI has a <code>window</code> object, which has a <code>document</code> property, and this document contains all the XML elements from <code>browser.xul</code>. All the Firefox menus, toolbars, sidebars, and tabs are XML elements in this document. Each tab element contains a <code>&lt;browser&gt;</code> element to display web content.</td>
