<p>Proxies are implemented transparently to necko users. This means that callers can just create an <code>{{ Interface("nsIChannel") }}</code>, not needing to worry about whether the channel will use a proxy or not</p>
<p>The basic interfaces for proxies are: {{ Interface("nsIProxyInfo") }}, {{ Interface("nsIProtocolProxyService") }}, and {{ interface("nsIProxiedProtocolHandler") }}</p>
<p><code>{{ Interface("nsIProxyInfo") }}</code> is a simple helper which stores information about the type of the proxy, its host and its port.</p>
<h2 id="nsIIOService" name="nsIIOService">nsIIOService</h2>
<p>The decision whether to use a proxy is made in <code>nsIOService::NewChannelFromURI</code>. It first asks the <code>{{ Interface("nsIProtocolProxyService") }}</code> for an nsIProxyInfo. Depending on the type of the proxy info, it either asks the HTTP Protocol Handler or the protocol handler for the requested URI for a new channel with the <code>{{ Interface("nsIProxyInfo") }}</code> - if the channel supports <code>{{ Interface("nsIProxiedProtocolHandler") }}</code>. Otherwise, the proxy info is discarded.</p>
<h2 id="nsIProtocolProxyService" name="nsIProtocolProxyService">nsIProtocolProxyService</h2>
<p>The most important function on <code>{{ Interface("nsIProtocolProxyService") }}</code> is <code>resolve</code>. It checks whether the passed-in URI should use a proxy, and returns an <code>{{ Interface("nsIProxyInfo") }}</code> if so.</p>
<p>This works by examining the <code>protocolFlags</code> of the protocol handler for the given URI. If this protocol handler does not support proxies, <code>resolve</code> returns null. Alternatively, if proxies are disabled, or this host is in the list of hosts for which no proxy should be used, null is also returned.</p>
<p>If PAC (proxy autoconfiguration) is enabled, it is asked for the proxy string for the given URI, which determines whether to use a proxy. Note that the PROXY method is only used when the protocol handler supports HTTP proxies, as indicated by its protocol flags.</p>
<p>Finally, depending on the protocol, the proxy info will be created with the appropriate type, host and port.</p>
<h2 id="SOCKS_and_nsISocketTransportService" name="SOCKS_and_nsISocketTransportService">SOCKS and nsISocketTransportService</h2>
<p>The aforementioned methods work very well for application-level proxies. However, SOCKS is transparent to upper-level protocols, and can transport any other TCP- or UDP-based protocol.</p>
<p>Therefore, <code>{{ Interface("nsISocketTransportService") }}</code> supports creating socket transports using an <code>{{ Interface("nsIProxyInfo") }}</code>. This proxy info will only be used if it specifies a SOCKS proxy, through which the connection is then made.</p>
<p>Note that SOCKS is implemented as an <code>nsISocketProvider</code>, and the socket transport service will therefore use it as as the downmost socket type.</p>
<p>{{ h1_gecko_minversion("Proxies and local hosts", "9.0") }}</p>
<p>Starting with Gecko 9.0 {{ geckoRelease("9.0") }}, proxy servers are not used when accessing hosts with no dots in their names, if manual proxy configuration is used and "&lt;local&gt;" is added to the "No proxy for:" text field field.</p>

<p>XXX missing paragraphs are about PAC, and more details about HTTP proxying, and maybe some more details about SOCKS proxies.</p>
