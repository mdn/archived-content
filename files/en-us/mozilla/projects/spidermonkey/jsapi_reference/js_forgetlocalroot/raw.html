<h3 id="Description" name="Description">Description</h3>
<p>This function is used to interact with scoped local root management. See {{jsapixref("JS_EnterLocalRootScope")}} for more on this topic.</p>
<p>In case a native hook allocates many objects or other GC-things, but the native protects some of those GC-things by storing them as property values in an object that is itself protected, the hook can call <code>JS_ForgetLocalRoot</code> to free the local root automatically pushed for the now-protected GC-thing. (Here the term <em>GC-thing</em> refers to any value that is subject to garbage collection: a <code>JSObject</code>, <code>JSString</code>, <code>JSFunction</code>, or <code>jsdouble</code>.)</p>
<p><code>JS_ForgetLocalRoot</code> works on any GC-thing allocated in the current local root scope, but it's more time-efficient when called on references to more recently created GC-things. Calling it successively on other than the most recently allocated GC-thing will tend to average the time inefficiency, and may risk O(n<sup>2</sup>) growth rate, but in any event, you shouldn't allocate too many local roots if you can root as you go (build a tree of objects from the top down, forgetting each latest-allocated GC-thing immediately upon linking it to its parent).</p>
<p>If the caller is not in any local root scope, <code>JS_ForgetLocalRoot</code> has no effect.</p>
