<p>Destroys all free-standing resources allocated by SpiderMonkey, not associated with any {{jsapixref("JSRuntime")}}, {{jsapixref("JSRuntime", "JSContext")}}, or other structure.</p>
<p>This method should be called after all other JSAPI data has been properly cleaned up: every {{jsapixref("JSRuntime")}} created with {{jsapixref("JS_NewRuntime")}} must have been destroyed with {{jsapixref("JS_DestroyRuntime")}}, every <code>JSContext</code> created with {{jsapixref("JS_NewContext")}} must have been destroyed with {{jsapixref("JS_DestroyContext")}}, and so on. Calling this method before all other resources have been destroyed has undefined behavior.</p>
<p>Failure to call this method, at present, has no adverse effects other than leaking memory. This may not always be the case; it's recommended that all embedders call this method when all other JSAPI operations have completed, to be future-proof.</p>
<p>It is currently not possible to initialize SpiderMonkey multiple times (that is, calling JS_Init, then other JSAPI methods, then JS_ShutDown in that order, then doing so again). This restriction may eventually be lifted.</p>
<p>Implementation note: This method has been used to clean up memory allocated by <code>jsdtoa.cpp</code>, memory allocated to implement {{jsxref("Date.now()")}} on Windows, and when the {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Intl", "Internationalization API", "", 1)}} is enabled, memory internally allocated by ICU. Exact details about what this method cleans up will vary depending upon the version of SpiderMonkey in use.</p>
