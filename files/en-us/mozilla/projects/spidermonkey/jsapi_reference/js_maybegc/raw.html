<h2 id="Description" name="Description">Description</h2>

<p><code>JS_MaybeGC</code> tries to determine whether garbage collection in <code>cx</code>'s runtime would free up enough memory to be worth the amount of time it would take. If so, it performs some garbage collection.</p>

<p>Calling <code>JS_MaybeGC</code> when the application is idle can help prevent garbage collection from happening at less convenient times. Calling <code>JS_MaybeGC</code> periodically when the application is busy, from a {{jsapixref("JS_SetBranchCallback", "JSBranchCallback")}} or {{jsapixref("JS_SetOperationCallback", "JSOperationCallback")}} {{ Jsapi_minversion_inline(1.8) }}, can keep memory usage down and improve performance. Both are good practices. In both cases, frequent calls <code>JS_MaybeGC</code> are safe and will not cause the application to spend a lot of time doing redundant garbage collection work.</p>

<p>Implementation note: SpiderMonkey 1.8 and earlier determine whether garbage collection is appropriate by analyzing statistics about the GC heap and memory usage since the last garbage collection cycle. The analysis is simplistic but produces acceptable performance for many applications. In some applications, <code>JS_MaybeGC</code> collects more often than it should for ideal performance. Such applications can benefit from implementing their own custom-tuned maybe-GC function that conditionally calls {{jsapixref("JS_GC")}} on the basis of some application-specific analysis, and using that instead of <code>JS_MaybeGC</code>.</p>

<p>To perform a full garbage collection unconditionally, use {{jsapixref("JS_GC")}}.</p>
