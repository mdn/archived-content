<p><strong><code>JS_SetParent</code></strong> sets an object's parent.</p>

<p>Each object may have at most one parent, which is another object. Applications that use SpiderMonkey's security features typically use the parent relation to determine both (a) what security principals are attached to the currently executing script; and (b) what security principals are attached to the object being accessed. (For some function objects, the parent chain is also used to implement lexical scoping, but this should be considered an implementation detail.)</p>

<p>Ordinarily an application sets a new object's parent by passing the parent object to {{jsapixref("JS_NewObject")}}, and that is the preferred approach. But an application may instead use <code>JS_SetParent</code> after the object is created.</p>

<p>Applications can get an object's parent using {{jsapixref("JS_GetParent")}}. Scripts can determine an object's parent by using the <code>__parent__</code> property, but scripts cannot assign to the <code>__parent__</code> property. In fact, once an object is exposed to a script, the object's parent must not change. The JavaScript engine relies on this invariant. <code>JS_SetParent</code> has no way to check that this is the case, but nonetheless, applications must not call <code>JS_SetParent</code> on an object that has already been exposed to a script. If an application does this, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>On success, <code>JS_SetParent</code> returns <code>JS_TRUE</code>. Otherwise, it reports an error or sets an exception and returns <code>JS_FALSE</code>.</p>
