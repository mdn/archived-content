    <td>A High-Level Overview to the Internals of <a href="/en-US/docs/NSS">Network Security Services (NSS)</a><br>
 <br>
 Software developed by the Mozilla.org projects traditionally used its own implementation of security protocols and cryptographic algorithms, originally called Netscape Security Services, nowadays called Network Security Services (NSS). NSS is a library written in the C programming language. It's free and open source software, and many other software projects have decided to use it. In order to support multiple operating systems (OS), it is based on a cross platform portability layer, called the Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR), which provides cross platform application programming interfaces (APIs) for OS specific APIs like file system access, memory management, network communication, and multithreaded programming.<br>
 <br>
 NSS offers lots of functionality; we'll walk through the list of modules, design principles, and important relevant standards.<br>
 <br>
 In order to allow interoperability between software and devices that perform cryptographic operations, NSS conforms to a standard called PKCS#11. (Note that it's important to look at the number 11, as there are other PKCS standards with different numbers that define quite different topics.)<br>
 <br>
 A software or hardware module conforming to the PKCS#11 standard implements an interface of C calls, which allow querying the characteristics and offered services of the module. Multiple elements of NSS's own modules have been implemented with this interface, and NSS makes use of this interface when talking to those modules. This strategy allows NSS to work with many hardware devices (e.g., to speed up the calculations required for cryptographic operations, or to access smartcards that securely protect a secret key) and software modules (e.g., to allow to load such modules as a plugin that provides additional algorithms or stores key or trust information) that implement the PKCS#11 interface.<br>
 <br>
 A core element of NSS is FreeBL, a base library providing hash functions, big number calculations, and cryptographic algorithms.<br>
 <br>
 Softoken is an NSS module that exposes most FreeBL functionality as a PKCS#11 module.<br>
 <br>
 Some cryptography uses the same secret key for both encrypting and decrypting, for example password based encryption (PBE). This is often sufficient if you encrypt data for yourself, but as soon as you need to exchange signed/encrypted data with communication partners, using public key encryption simplifies the key management. The environment that describes how to use public key encryption is called Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The public keys that are exchanged between parties are transported using a container; the container is called a certificate, following standard X.509 version 3. A certificate contains lots of other details; for example, it contains a signature by a third party that expresses trust in the ownership relationship for the certificate. The trust assigned by the third party might be restricted to certain uses, which are listed in certificate extensions that are contained in the certificate.<br>
 <br>
 Many (if not most) of the operations performed by NSS involve the use of X.509 certificates (often abbreviated as “cert”, unfortunately making it easy to confuse with the term “computer emergency response team“).<br>
 <br>
 When checking whether a certificate is trusted or not, it's necessary to find a relevant trust anchor (root certificate) that represents the signing capability of a trusted third party, usually called a Certificate Authority (CA). A trust anchor is just another X.509 certificate that is already known and has been deliberately marked as trusted by a software vendor, administrators inside an organizational infrastructure, or the software user. NSS ships a predefined set of CA certificates. This set, including their trust assignments, is provided by NSS as a software module, called CKBI (“built-in root certificates”), which also implements the PKCS#11 interface. On an organizational level the contents of the set are managed according to the Mozilla CA policy. On a technical level the set is a binary software module.<br>
 <br>
 A cryptographic transaction, such as encryption or decryption related to a data exchange, usually involves working with the X.509 certs of your communication partners (peer). It's also required that you safely keep your own secret keys that belong to your own certificates. You might want to protect the storage of your secret keys with PBE. You might decide to modify the default trust provided by NSS. All of this requires storing, looking up, and retrieving data. NSS simplifies performing these operations by offering storage and management APIs. NSS doesn't require the programmer to manage individual files containing individual certificates or keys. Instead, NSS offers to use its own database(s). Once you have imported certificates and keys into the NSS database, you can easily look them up and use them again.<br>
 <br>
 Because of NSS's expectation to operate with an NSS database, it's mandatory that you perform an initialization call, where you tell NSS which database you will be using. In the most simple scenario, the programmer will provide a directory on your filesystem as a parameter to the init function, and NSS is designed to do the rest. It will detect and open an existing database, or it can create a new one. Alternatively, should you decide that you don't want to work with any persistent recording of certificates, you may initialize NSS in a no-database mode. Usually, NSS will flush all data to disk as soon as new data has been added to permanent storage. Storage consists of multiple files: a key database file, which contains your secret keys, and a certificate database file which contains the public portion of your own certificates, the certificates of peers or CAs, and a list of trust decisions (such as to not trust a built-in CA, or to explicitly trust other CAs). Examples for the database files are key3.db and cert8.db, where the numbers are file version numbers. A third file contains the list of external PKCS#11 modules that have been registered to be used by NSS. The file could be named secmod.db, but in newer database generations a file named pkcs11.txt is used.<br>
 <br>
 Only NSS is allowed to access and manipulate these database files directly; a programmer using NSS must go through the APIs offered by NSS to manipulate the data stored in these files. The programmer's task is to initialize NSS with the required parameters (such as a database), and NSS will then transparently manage the database files.<br>
 <br>
 Most of the time certificates and keys are supposed to be stored in the NSS database. Therefore, after initial import or creation, the programmer usually doesn't deal with their raw bytes. Instead, the programmer will use lookup functions, and NSS will provide an access handle that will be subsequently used by the application's code. Those handles are reference counted. NSS will usually create an in-memory (RAM) presentation of certificates, once a certificate has been received from the network, read from disk, or looked up from the database, and prepare in-memory data structures that contain the certificate's properties, as well as providing a handle for the programmer to use. Once the application is done with a handle, it should be released, allowing NSS to free the associated resources. When working with handles to private keys it's usually difficult (and undesired) that an application gets access to the raw key data; therefore it may be difficult to extract such data from NSS. The usual minimum requirement is that private keys must be wrapped using a protective layer (such as password-based encryption). The intention is to make it easier to review code for security. The less code that has access to raw secret keys, the less code that must be reviewed.<br>
 <br>
 NSS has only limited functionality to look up raw keys. The preferred approach is to use certificates, and to look up certificates by properties such as the contained subject name (information that describes the owner of the certificate). For example, while NSS supports random calculation (creation) of a new public/private key pair, it's difficult to work with such a raw key pair. The usual approach is to create a certificate signing request (CSR) as soon as an application is done with the creation step, which will have created a handle to the key pair, and which can be used for the necessary related operations, like producing a proof-of-ownership of the private key, which is usually required when submitting the public key with a CSR to a CA. The usual follow up action is receiving a signed certificate from a CA. (However, it's also possible to use NSS functionality to create a self-signed certificate, which, however, usually won't be trusted by other parties.) Once received, it's sufficient to tell NSS to import such a new certificate into the NSS database, and NSS will automatically perform a lookup of the embedded public key, be able to find the associated private key, and subsequently be able to treat it as a personal certificate. (A personal certificate is a certificate for which the private key is in possession, and which could be used for signing data or for decrypting data.) A unique nickname can/should be assigned to the certificate at the time of import, which can later be used to easily identify and retrieve it.<br>
 <br>
 It's important to note that NSS requires strict cleanup for all handles returned by NSS. The application should always call the appropriate dereference (destroy) functions once a handle is no longer needed. This is particularly important for applications that might need to close a database and reinitialize NSS using a different one, without restarting. Such an operation might fail at runtime if data elements are still being referenced.<br>
 <br>
 In addition to the FreeBL, Softoken, and CKBI modules, there is an utility library for general operations (e.g., encoding/decoding between data formats, a list of standardized object identifiers (OID)). NSS has an SSL/TLS module that implements the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security network protocols, an S/MIME module that implements CMS messaging used by secure email and some instant messaging implementations, a DBM library that implements the classic database storage, and finally a core NSS library for the big set of “everything else”. Newer generations of the database use the SQLite database to allow concurrent access by multiple applications.<br>
 <br>
 All of the above are provided as shared libraries. The CRMF library, which is used to produce certain kinds of certificate requests, is available as a library for static linking only.<br>
 <br>
 When dealing with certificates (X.509), file formats such as PKCS#12 (certificates and keys), PKCS#7 (signed data), and message formats as CMS, we should mention ASN.1, which is a syntax for storing structured data in a very efficient (small sized) presentation. It was originally developed for telecommunication systems at times where it was critical to minimize data as much as possible (although it still makes sense to use that principle today for good performance). In order to process data available in the ASN.1 format, the usual approach is to parse it and transfer it to a presentation that requires more space but is easier to work with, such as (nested) C data structures. Over the time NSS has received three different ASN.1 parser implementations, each having their own specific properties, advantages and disadvantages, which is why all of them are still being used (nobody has yet dared to replace the older with the newer ones because of risks for side effects). When using the ASN.1 parser(s), a template definition is passed to the parser, which will analyze the ASN.1 data stream accordingly. The templates are usually closely aligned to definitions found in RFC documents.<br>
 <br>
 A data block described as DER is usually in ASN.1 format. You must know which data you are expecting, and use the correct template for parsing, based on the context of your software's interaction. Data described as PEM is a base64 encoded presentation of DER, usually wrapped between human readable BEGIN/END lines. NSS prefers the binary presentation, but is often capable to use base64 or ASCII presentations, especially when importing data from files. A recent development adds support for loading external PEM files that contain private keys, in a software library called nss-pem, which is separately available, but should eventually become a core part of NSS.<br>
 <br>
 Looking at the code level, NSS deals with blocks of raw data all the time. The common structure to store such an untyped block is SECItem, which contains a size and an untyped C pointer variable.<br>
 <br>
 When dealing with memory, NSS makes use of arenas, which are an attempt to simplify management with the limited offerings of C (because there are no destructors). The idea is to group multiple memory allocations in order to simplify cleanup. Performing an operation often involves allocating many individual data items, and the code might be required to abort a task at many positions in the logic. An arena is requested once processing of a task starts, and all memory allocations that are logically associated to that task are requested from the associated arena. The implementation of arenas makes sure that all individual memory blocks are tracked. Once a task is done, regardless whether it completed or was aborted, the programmer simply needs to release the arena, and all individually allocated blocks will be released automatically. Often freeing is combined with immediately erasing (zeroing, zfree) the memory associated to the arena, in order to make it more difficult for attackers to extract keys from a memory dump.<br>
 <br>
 NSS uses many C data structures. Often NSS has multiple implementations for the same or similar concepts. For example, there are multiple presentations of certificates, and the NSS internals (and sometimes even the application using NSS) might have to convert between them.<br>
 <br>
 Key responsibilites of NSS are verification of signatures and certificates. In order to verify a digital signature, we have to look at the application data (e.g., a document that was signed), the signature data block (the digital signature), and a public key (as found in a certificate that is believed to be the signer, e.g., identified by metadata received together with the signature). The signature is verified if it can be shown that the signature data block must have been produced by the owner of the public key (because only that owner has the associated private key).<br>
 <br>
 Verifying a certificate (A) requires some additional steps. First, you must identify the potential signer (B) of a certificate (A). This is done by reading the “issuer name” attribute of a certificate (A), and trying to find that issuer certificate (B) (by looking for a certificate that uses that name as its “subject name”). Then you attempt to verify the signature found in (A) using the public key found in (B). It might be necessary to try multiple certificates (B1, B2, ...) each having the same subject name.<br>
 <br>
 After succeeding, it might be necessary to repeat this procedure recursively. The goal is to eventually find a certificate B (or C or ...) that has an appropriate trust assigned (e.g., because it can be found in the CKBI module and the user hasn't made any overriding trust decisions, or it can be found in a NSS database file managed by the user or by the local environment).<br>
 <br>
 After having successfully verified the signatures in a (chain of) issuer certificate(s), we're still not done with verifying the certificate A. In a PKI it's suggested/required to perform additional checks. For example: Certificates were valid at the time the signature was made, name in certificates matches the expected signer (check subject name, common name, email, based on application), the trust restrictions recorded inside the certificate (extensions) permit the use (e.g., encryption might be allowed, but not signing), and based on environment/application policy it might be required to perform a revocation check (OCSP or CRL), that asks the issuer(s) of the certificates whether there have been events that made it necessary to revoke the trust (revoke the validity of the cert).<br>
 <br>
 Trust anchors contained in the CKBI module are usually self signed, which is defined as having identical subject name and issuer name fields. If a self-signed certificate is marked as explicitly trusted, NSS will skip checking the self-signature for validity.<br>
 <br>
 NSS has multiple APIs to perform verification of certificates. There is a classic engine that is very stable and works fine in all simple scenarios, for example if all (B) candidate issuer certificates have the same subject and issuer names and differ by validity period; however, it works only in a limited amount of more advanced scenarios. Unfortunately, the world of certificates has become more complex in the recent past. New Certificate Authorities enter the global PKI market, and in order to get started with their business, they might make deals with established CAs and receive so-called cross-signing-certificates. As a result, when searching for a trust path from (A) to a trusted anchor (root) certificate (Z), the set of candidate issuer certificates might have different issuer names (referring to the second or higher issuer level). As a consequence, it will be necessary to try multiple different alternative routes while searching for (Z), in a recursive manner. Only the newer verification engine (internally named libPKIX) is capable of doing that properly.<br>
 <br>
 It's worth mentioning the Extended Validation (EV) principle, which is an effort by software vendors and CAs to define a stricter set of rules for issuing certificates for web site certificates. Instead of simply verifying that the requester of a certificate is in control of an administrative email address at the desired web site's domain, it's required that the CA performs a verification of real world identity documents (such as a company registration document with the country's authority), and it's also required that a browser software performs a revocation check with the CA, prior to granting validity to the certificate. In order to distinguish an EV certificate, CAs will embed a policy OID in the certificate, and the browser is expected to verify that a trust chain permits the end entity (EE) certificate to make use of the policy. Only the APIs of the newer libPKIX engine are capable of performing a policy verification.<br>
 <br>
 That's a good opportunity to talk about SSL/TLS connections to servers in general (not just EV, not just websites). Whenever this document mentions SSL, it refers to either SSL or TLS. (TLS is a newer version of SSL with enhanced features.)<br>
 <br>
 When establishing an SSL connection to a server, (at least) a server certificate (and its trust chain) is exchanged from the server to the client (e.g., the browser), and the client verifies that the certificate can be verified (including matching the name of the expected destination server). Another part of the handshake between both parties is a key exchange. Because public key encryption is more expensive (more calculations required) than symmetric encryption (where both parties use the same key), a key agreement protocol will be executed, where the public and private keys are used to proof and verify the exchanged initial information. Once the key agreement is done, a symmetric encryption will be used (until a potential re-handshake on an existing channel). The combination of the hash and encryption algorithms used for a SSL connection is called a cipher suite.<br>
 <br>
 NSS ships with a set of cipher suites that it supports at a technical level. In addition, NSS ships with a default policy that defines which cipher suites are enabled by default. An application is able to modify the policy used at program runtime, by using function calls to modify the set of enabled cipher suites.<br>
 <br>
 If a programmer wants to influence how NSS verifies certificates or how NSS verifies the data presented in a SSL connection handshake, it is possible to register application-defined callback functions which will be called by NSS at the appropriate point of time, and which can be used to override the decisions made by NSS.<br>
 <br>
 If you would like to use NSS as a toolkit that implements SSL, remember that you must init NSS first. But if you don't care about modifying the default trust permanently (recorded on disk), you can use the no-database init calls. When creating the network socket for data exchange, note that you must use the operating system independent APIs provided by NSPR and NSS. It might be interesting to mention a property of the NSPR file descriptors, which are stacked in layers. This means you can define multiple layers that are involved in data processing. A file descriptor has a pointer to the first layer handling the data. That layer has a pointer to a potential second layer, which might have another pointer to a third layer, etc. Each layer defines its own functions for the open/close/read/write/poll/select (etc.) functions. When using an SSL network connection, you'll already have two layers, the basic NSPR layer and an SSL library layer. The Mozilla applications define a third layer where application specific processing is performed. You can find more details in the NSPR reference documents.<br>
 <br>
 NSS occassionally has to create outbound network connections, in addition to the connections requested by the application. Examples are retrieving OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) information or downloading a CRL (Certificate Revocation List). However, NSS doesn't have an implementation to work with network proxies. If you must support proxies in your application, you are able to register your own implementation of an http request callback interface, and NSS can use your application code that supports proxies.<br>
 <br>
 When using hashing, encryption, and decryption functions, it is possible to stream data (as opposed to operating on a large buffer). Create a context handle while providing all the parameters required for the operation, then call an “update” function multiple times to pass subsets of the input to NSS. The data will be processed and either returned directly or sent to a callback function registered in the context. When done, you call a finalization function that will flush out any pending data and free the resources.<br>
 <br>
 This line is a placeholder for future sections that should explain how libpkix works and is designed.<br>
 <br>
 If you want to work with NSS, it's often helpful to use the command line utilities that are provided by the NSS developers. There are tools for managing NSS databases, for dumping or verifying certificates, for registering PKCS#11 modules with a database, for processing CMS encrypted/signed messages, etc.<br>
 <br>
 For example, if you wanted to create your own pair of keys and request a new certificate from a CA, you could use certutil to create an empty database, then use certutil to operate on your database and create a certificate request (which involves creating the desired key pair) and export it to a file, submit the request file to the CA, receive the file from the CA, and import the certificate into your database. You should assign a good nickname to a certificate when importing it, making it easier for you to refer to it later.<br>
 <br>
 It should be noted that the first database format that can be accessed simultaneously by multiple applications is key4.db/cert9.db – database files with lower numbers will most likely experience unrecoverable corruption if you access them with multiple applications at the same time. In other words, if your browser or your server operates on an older NSS database format, don't use the NSS tools to operate on it while the other software is executing. At the time of writing NSS and the Mozilla applications still use the older database file format by default, where each application has its own NSS database.<br>
 <br>
 If you require a copy of a certificate stored in an NSS database, including its private key, you can use pk12util to export it to the PKCS#12 file format. If you require it in PEM format, you could use the openssl pkcs12 command (that's not NSS) to convert the PKCS#12 file to PEM.<br>
 <br>
 This line is a placeholder for how to prepare a database, how to dump a cert, and how to convert data.<br>
 <br>
 You might have been motivated to work with NSS because it is used by the Mozilla applications such as Firefox, Thunderbird, etc. If you build the Mozilla application, it will automatically build the NSS library, too. However, if you want to work with the NSS command line tools, you will have to follow the standalone NSS build instructions, and build NSS outside of the Mozilla application sources.<br>
 <br>
 The key database file will contain at least one symmetric key, which NSS will automatically create on demand, and which will be used to protect your secret (private) keys. The symmetric key can be protected with PBE by setting a master password on the database. As soon as you set a master password, an attacker stealing your key database will no longer be able to get access to your private key, unless the attacker would also succeed in stealing the master password.<br>

 <br>
 Synopsis<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; certutil [options] [[arguments]]<br>
 <br>
 Description<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Certificate Database Tool, certutil, is a command-line utility<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; that can create and modify certificate and key databases.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It can specifically list, generate, modify, or delete certificates, create or<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; change the password, generate new public and private key pairs,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; display the contents of the key database, or delete key pairs within&nbsp; the key database.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate issuance, part of the key and certificate management process, requires that<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; keys and certificates be created in the key database. This document discusses certificate<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; and key database management. For information on the&nbsp; security module database management,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; see the modutil manpage.<br>
 <br>
 Options and Arguments<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Running certutil always requires one and only one command option to<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; specify the type of certificate operation. Each option may take arguments,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere from none to multiple arguments. The command option -H will list<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; all the command options available and their relevant arguments.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Command Options<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; -A<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add an existing certificate to a certificate database.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The certificate database should already exist; if one is<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not present, this command option will initialize one by default.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; -B<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run a series of commands from the specified batch file.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This requires the -i argument.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; -C<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a new binary certificate file from a binary<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate request file. Use the -i argument to specify<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate request file. If this argument is not<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used, certutil prompts for a filename.<br>
 <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; -D<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete a certificate from the certificate database.</td>

&nbsp;&nbsp; certutil — Manage keys and certificate in the NSS database.<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certutil [options] <a href="arguments">arguments</a><br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Certificate Database Tool, certutil, is a command-line utility that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; can create and modify certificate and key database files. It can also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; list, generate, modify, or delete certificates within the database, create<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; or change the password, generate new public and private key pairs, display<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the contents of the key database, or delete key pairs within the key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The key and certificate management process generally begins with creating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; keys in the key database, then generating and managing certificates in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate database. This document discusses certificate and key database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; management. For information security module database management, see the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil manpages.<br>
<br>
Options and Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Running certutil always requires one (and only one) option to specify the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; type of certificate operation. Each option may take arguments, anywhere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; from none to multiple arguments. Run the command option and -H to see the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments available for each command option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options specify an action and are uppercase.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -A<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add an existing certificate to a certificate database. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate database should already exist; if one is not present,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this option will initialize one by default.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -B<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run a series of commands from the specified batch file. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requires the -i argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -C<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a new binary certificate file from a binary certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request file. Use the -i argument to specify the certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request file. If this argument is not used, certutil prompts for a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; filename.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -D<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete a certificate from the certificate database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -E<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add an email certificate to the certificate database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -F<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete a private key from a key database. Specify the key to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete with the -n argument. Specify the database from which to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delete the key with the -d argument. Use the -k argument to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify explicitly whether to delete a DSA, RSA, or ECC key. If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't use the -k argument, the option looks for an RSA key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; matching the specified nickname.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you delete keys, be sure to also remove any certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; associated with those keys from the certificate database, by using<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -D. Some smart cards (for example, the Litronic card) do not let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you remove a public key you have generated. In such a case, only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the private key is deleted from the key pair. You can display the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public key with the command certutil -K -h tokenname.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -G<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generate a new public and private key pair within a key database.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The key database should already exist; if one is not present, this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option will initialize one by default. Some smart cards (for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, the Litronic card) can store only one key pair. If you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a new key pair for such a card, the previous pair is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overwritten.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -H<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display a list of the options and arguments used by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate Database Tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -K<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List the key ID of keys in the key database. A key ID is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modulus of the RSA key or the publicValue of the DSA key. IDs are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; displayed in hexadecimal ("0x" is not shown).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -L<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List all the certificates, or display information about a named<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate, in a certificate database. Use the -h tokenname<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument to specify the certificate database on a particular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hardware or software token.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -M<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Modify a certificate's trust attributes using the values of the -t<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -N<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create new certificate and key databases.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -O<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print the certificate chain.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -R<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a certificate request file that can be submitted to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificate Authority (CA) for processing into a finished<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate. Output defaults to standard out unless you use -o<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output-file argument. Use the -a argument to specify ASCII output.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -S<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create an individual certificate and add it to a certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -T<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset the key database or token.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -U<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List all available modules or print a single named module.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -V<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check the validity of a certificate and its attributes.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -W<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the password to a key database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --merge<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge a source database into the target database. This is used to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merge legacy NSS databases (cert8.db and key3.db) into the newer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SQLite databases (cert9.db and key4.db).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --upgrade-merge<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrade an old database and merge it into a new database. This is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used to migrate legacy NSS databases (cert8.db and key3.db) into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the newer SQLite databases (cert9.db and key4.db).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Option arguments modify an action and are lowercase.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -a<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use ASCII format or allow the use of ASCII format for input or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output. This formatting follows RFC 1113. For certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; requests, ASCII output defaults to standard output unless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redirected.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -b validity-time<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a time at which a certificate is required to be valid. Use<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when checking certificate validity with the -V option. The format<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the validity-time argument is YYMMDDHHMMSS[+HHMM|-HHMM|Z],<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which allows offsets to be set relative to the validity end time.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifying seconds (SS) is optional. When specifying an explicit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time, use a Z at the end of the term, YYMMDDHHMMSSZ, to close it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When specifying an offset time, use YYMMDDHHMMSS+HHMM or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YYMMDDHHMMSS-HHMM for adding or subtracting time, respectively.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this option is not used, the validity check defaults to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current system time.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -c issuer<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify the certificate of the CA from which a new certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will derive its authenticity. Use the exact nickname or alias of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the CA certificate, or use the CA's email address. Bracket the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; issuer string with quotation marks if it contains spaces.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the database directory containing the certificate and key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certutil supports two types of databases: the legacy security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt). If the prefix sql:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not used, then the tool assumes that the given databases are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old format.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -e<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check a certificate's signature during the process of validating a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -f password-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a file that will automatically supply the password to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include in a certificate or to access a certificate database. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a plain-text file containing one password. Be sure to prevent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unauthorized access to this file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -g keysize<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set a key size to use when generating new public and private key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pairs. The minimum is 512 bits and the maximum is 8192 bits. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default is 1024 bits. Any size between the minimum and maximum is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -h tokenname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the name of a token to use or act on. Unless specified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise the default token is an internal slot (specifically,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; internal slot 2). This slot can also be explicitly named with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string "internal". An internal slots is a virtual slot maintained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in software, rather than a hardware device. Internal slot 2 is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used by key and certificate services. Internal slot 1 is used by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cryptographic services.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -i input_file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass an input file to the command. Depending on the command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option, an input file can be a specific certificate, a certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request file, or a batch file of commands.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -k rsa|dsa|ec|all<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the type of a key. The valid options are RSA, DSA, ECC, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all. The default value is rsa. Specifying the type of key can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid mistakes caused by duplicate nicknames.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -k key-type-or-id<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the type or specific ID of a key. Giving a key type<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates a new key pair; giving the ID of an existing key reuses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that key pair (which is required to renew certificates).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -l<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display detailed information when validating a certificate with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the -V option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -m serial-number<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assign a unique serial number to a certificate being created. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operation should be performed by a CA. The default serial number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is 0 (zero). Serial numbers are limited to integers.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -n nickname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the nickname of a certificate or key to list, create, add<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to a database, modify, or validate. Bracket the nickname string<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with quotation marks if it contains spaces.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -o output-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the output file name for new certificates or binary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate requests. Bracket the output-file string with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quotation marks if it contains spaces. If this argument is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used the output destination defaults to standard output.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -P dbPrefix<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the prefix used on the certificate and key database file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option is provided as a special case. Changing the names of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate and key databases is not recommended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -p phone<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a contact telephone number to include in new certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or certificate requests. Bracket this string with quotation marks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if it contains spaces.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -q pqgfile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read an alternate PQG value from the specified file when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generating DSA key pairs. If this argument is not used, certutil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generates its own PQG value. PQG files are created with a separate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DSA utility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -q curve-name<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the elliptic curve name to use when generating ECC key pairs.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A complete list of ECC curves is given in the help (-H).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -r<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display a certificate's binary DER encoding when listing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information about that certificate with the -L option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -s subject<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identify a particular certificate owner for new certificates or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate requests. Bracket this string with quotation marks if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it contains spaces. The subject identification format follows RFC<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; -t trustargs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the trust attributes to modify in an existing certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or to apply to a certificate when creating it or adding it to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database. There are three available trust categories for each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate, expressed in the order SSL, email, object signing for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each trust setting. In each category position, use none, any, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the attribute codes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;p - Valid peer<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;P - Trusted peer (implies p)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;c - Valid CA<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;T - Trusted CA to issue client certificates (implies c)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;C - Trusted CA to issue server certificates (SSL only)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (implies c)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;u - Certificate can be used for authentication or signing<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;w - Send warning (use with other attributes to include a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; warning when the certificate is used in that context)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attribute codes for the categories are separated by commas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the entire set of attributes enclosed by quotation marks. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -t "TCu,Cu,Tuw"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the -L option to see a list of the current certificates and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trust attributes in a certificate database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -u certusage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a usage context to apply when validating a certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the -V option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contexts are the following:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;C (as an SSL client)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;V (as an SSL server)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;S (as an email signer)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;R (as an email recipient)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;O (as an OCSP status responder)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;J (as an object signer)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -v valid-months<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the number of months a new certificate will be valid. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; validity period begins at the current system time unless an offset<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is added or subtracted with the -w option. If this argument is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used, the default validity period is three months. When this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument is used, the default three-month period is automatically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; added to any value given in the valid-month argument. For example,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using this option to set a value of 3 would cause 3 to be added to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the three-month default, creating a validity period of six months.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use negative values to reduce the default period. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, setting a value of -2 would subtract 2 from the default<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and create a validity period of one month.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -w offset-months<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set an offset from the current system time, in months, for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning of a certificate's validity period. Use when creating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate or adding it to a database. Express the offset in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integers, using a minus sign (-) to indicate a negative offset. If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this argument is not used, the validity period begins at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; current system time. The length of the validity period is set with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the -v argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -X<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Force the key and certificate database to open in read-write mode.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is used with the -U and -L command options.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -x<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use certutil to generate the signature for a certificate being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; created or added to a database, rather than obtaining a signature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from a separate CA.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -y exp<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set an alternate exponent value to use in generating a new RSA<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public key for the database, instead of the default value of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65537. The available alternate values are 3 and 17.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -z noise-file<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read a seed value from the specified file to generate a new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private and public key pair. This argument makes it possible to<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating New Security Databases<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificates, keys, and security modules related to managing certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are stored in three related databases:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert8.db or cert9.db<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key3.db or key4.db<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;secmod.db or pkcs11.txt<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; These databases must be created before certificates or keys can be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; generated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -N -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a Certificate Request<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A certificate request contains most or all of the information that is used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to generate the final certificate. This request is submitted separately to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a certificate authority and is then approved by some mechanism<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (automatically or by human review). Once the request is approved, then the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate is generated.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -R -k key-type-or-id [-q pqgfile|curve-name] -g key-size -s subject [-h tokenname] -d [sql:]directory [-p phone] [-o output-file] [-a]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The -R command options requires four arguments:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;-k to specify either the key type to generate or, when renewing a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate, the existing key pair to use<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;-g to set the keysize of the key to generate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;-s to set the subject name of the certificate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;-d to give the security database directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The new certificate request can be output in ASCII format (-a) or can be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; written to a specified file (-o).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -R -k ec -q nistb409 -g 512 -s "CN=John Smith,O=Example Corp,L=Mountain View,ST=California,C=US" -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -p 650-555-0123 -a -o cert.cer<br>

&nbsp;-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating a Certificate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A valid certificate must be issued by a trusted CA. This can be done by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specifying a CA certificate (-c) that is stored in the certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database. If a CA key pair is not available, you can create a self-signed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate using the -x argument with the -S command option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -S -k rsa|dsa|ec -n certname -s subject [-c issuer |-x] -t trustargs -d [sql:]directory [-m serial-number] [-v valid-months] [-w offset-months] [-p phone] [-1] [-2] [-3] [-4] [-5 keyword] [-6 keyword] [-7 emailAddress] [-8 dns-names] [--extAIA] [--extSIA] [--extCP] [--extPM] [--extPC] [--extIA] [--extSKID]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The series of numbers and --ext* options set certificate extensions that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; can be added to the certificate when it is generated by the CA.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, this creates a self-signed certificate:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -S -s "CN=Example CA" -n my-ca-cert -x -t "C,C,C" -1 -2 -5 -m 3650<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, new certificates can reference the self-signed certificate:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -S -s "CN=My Server Cert" -n my-server-cert -c "my-ca-cert" -t "u,u,u" -1 -5 -6 -8 -m 730<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Generating a Certificate from a Certificate Request<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When a certificate request is created, a certificate can be generated by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; using the request and then referencing a certificate authority signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate (the issuer specified in the -c argument). The issuing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate must be in the certificate database in the specified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -C -c issuer -i cert-request-file -o output-file [-m serial-number] [-v valid-months] [-w offset-months] -d [sql:]directory [-1] [-2] [-3] [-4] [-5 keyword] [-6 keyword] [-7 emailAddress] [-8 dns-names]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -C -c "my-ca-cert" -i /home/certs/cert.req -o cert.cer -m 010 -v 12 -w 1 -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -1 nonRepudiation,dataEncipherment -5 sslClient -6 clientAuth -7 <a class=" link-mailto" href="mailto:jsmith@example.com">jsmith@example.com</a><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Generating Key Pairs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Key pairs are generated automatically with a certificate request or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate, but they can also be generated independently using the -G<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -G -d [sql:]directory | -h tokenname -k key-type -g key-size [-y exponent-value] -q pqgfile|curve-name<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -G -h lunasa -k ec -g 256 -q sect193r2<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing Certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The -L command option lists all of the certificates listed in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate database. The path to the directory (-d) is required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -L -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Certificate Nickname&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Attributes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using additional arguments with -L can return and print the information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for a single, specific certificate. For example, the -n argument passes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate name, while the -a argument prints the certificate in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ASCII format:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -L -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -a -n "Certificate Authority - Example Domain"<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing Keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keys are the original material used to encrypt certificate data. The keys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; generated for certificates are stored separately, in the key database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To list all keys in the database, use the -K command option and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (required) -d argument to give the path to the directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -K -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
&nbsp;certutil: Checking token "NSS Certificate DB" in slot "NSS User Private Key and Certificate Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<br>
&nbsp;&lt; 0&gt; rsa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 455a6673bde9375c2887ec8bf8016b3f9f35861d&nbsp;&nbsp; Thawte Freemail Member's Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. ID<br>
&nbsp;&lt; 1&gt; rsa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 40defeeb522ade11090eacebaaf1196a172127df&nbsp;&nbsp; Example Domain Administrator Cert<br>
&nbsp;&lt; 2&gt; rsa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1d0b06f44f6c03842f7d4f4a1dc78b3bcd1b85a5&nbsp;&nbsp; John Smith user cert<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; There are ways to narrow the keys listed in the search results:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;To return a specific key, use the -n name argument with the name of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the key.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;If there are multiple security devices loaded, then the -h tokenname<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument can search a specific token or all tokens.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;If there are multiple key types available, then the -k key-type<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument can search a specific type of key, like RSA, DSA, or ECC.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing Security Modules<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The devices that can be used to store certificates -- both internal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases and external devices like smart cards -- are recognized and used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; by loading security modules. The -U command option lists all of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security modules listed in the secmod.db database. The path to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; directory (-d) is required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -U -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot: NSS User Private Key and Certificate Services<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; token: NSS Certificate DB<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot: NSS Internal Cryptographic Services<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; token: NSS Generic Crypto Services<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding Certificates to the Database<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Existing certificates or certificate requests can be added manually to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate database, even if they were generated elsewhere. This uses the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -A command option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -A -n certname -t trustargs -d [sql:]directory [-a] [-i input-file]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -A -n "CN=My SSL Certificate" -t "u,u,u" -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -i /home/example-certs/cert.cer<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A related command option, -E, is used specifically to add email<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates to the certificate database. The -E command has the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments as the -A command. The trust arguments for certificates have the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; format SSL,S/MIME,Code-signing, so the middle trust settings relate most<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to email certificates (though the others can be set). For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -E -n "CN=John Smith Email Cert" -t ",Pu," -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -i /home/example-certs/email.cer<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting Certificates to the Database<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificates can be deleted from a database using the -D option. The only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required options are to give the security database directory and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; identify the certificate nickname.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -D -d [sql:]directory -n "nickname"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -D -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -n "my-ssl-cert"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Validating Certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A certificate contains an expiration date in itself, and expired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates are easily rejected. However, certificates can also be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; revoked before they hit their expiration date. Checking whether a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate has been revoked requires validating the certificate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Validation can also be used to ensure that the certificate is only used<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; for the purposes it was initially issued for. Validation is carried out by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the -V command option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -V -n certificate-name [-b time] [-e] [-u cert-usage] -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, to validate an email certificate:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -V -n "John Smith's Email Cert" -e -u S,R -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Modifying Certificate Trust Settings<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The trust settings (which relate to the operations that a certificate is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed to be used for) can be changed after a certificate is created or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; added to the database. This is especially useful for CA certificates, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; it can be performed for any type of certificate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -M -n certificate-name -t trust-args -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -M -n "My CA Certificate" -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -t "CTu,CTu,CTu"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Printing the Certificate Chain<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificates can be issued in chains because every certificate authority<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; itself has a certificate; when a CA issues a certificate, it essentially<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; stamps that certificate with its own fingerprint. The -O prints the full<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; chain of a certificate, going from the initial CA (the root CA) through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ever intermediary CA to the actual certificate. For example, for an email<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate with two CAs in the chain:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -O -n "<a class=" link-mailto" href="mailto:jsmith@example.com">jsmith@example.com</a>"<br>
&nbsp;"Builtin Object Token:Thawte Personal Freemail CA" [<a class=" link-mailto" href="mailto:E=personal-freemail@thawte.com,CN=Thawte">E=personal-freemail@thawte.com,CN=Thawte</a> Personal Freemail CA,OU=Certification Services Division,O=Thawte Consulting,L=Cape Town,ST=Western Cape,C=ZA]<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Resetting a Token<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The device which stores certificates -- both external hardware devices and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; internal software databases -- can be blanked and reused. This operation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is performed on the device which stores the data, not directly on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security databases, so the location must be referenced through the token<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; name (-h) as well as any directory path. If there is no external token<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; used, the default value is internal.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil -T -d [sql:]directory -h token-name -0 security-officer-password<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Many networks have dedicated personnel who handle changes to security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; tokens (the security officer). This person must supply the password to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; access the specified token. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -T -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -h nethsm -0 secret<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upgrading or Merging the Security Databases<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Many networks or applications may be using older BerkeleyDB versions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate database (cert8.db). Databases can be upgraded to the new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; SQLite version of the database (cert9.db) using the --upgrade-merge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command option or existing databases can be merged with the new cert9.db<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases using the ---merge command.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The --upgrade-merge command must give information about the original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database and then use the standard arguments (like -d) to give the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information about the new databases. The command also requires information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that the tool uses for the process to upgrade and write over the original<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil --upgrade-merge -d [sql:]directory [-P dbprefix] --source-dir directory --source-prefix dbprefix --upgrade-id id --upgrade-token-name name [-@ password-file]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil --upgrade-merge -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb --source-dir /opt/my-app/alias/ --source-prefix serverapp- --upgrade-id 1 --upgrade-token-name internal<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The --merge command only requires information about the location of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; original database; since it doesn't change the format of the database, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; can write over information without performing interim step.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;certutil --merge -d [sql:]directory [-P dbprefix] --source-dir directory --source-prefix dbprefix [-@ password-file]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil --merge -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb --source-dir /opt/my-app/alias/ --source-prefix serverapp-<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Running certutil Commands from a Batch File<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A series of commands can be run sequentially from a text file with the -B<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command option. The only argument for this specifies the input file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -B -i /path/to/batch-file<br>
<br>
NSS Database Types<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS originally used BerkeleyDB databases to store security information.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last versions of these legacy databases are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert8.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key3.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;secmod.db for PKCS #11 module information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BerkeleyDB has performance limitations, though, which prevent it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being easily used by multiple applications simultaneously. NSS has some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; flexibility that allows applications to use their own, independent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database engine while keeping a shared database and working around the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; access issues. Still, NSS requires more flexibility to provide a truly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared security database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, NSS introduced a new set of databases that are SQLite databases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than BerkleyDB. These new databases provide more accessibility and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; performance:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert9.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key4.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;pkcs11.txt, which is listing of all of the PKCS #11 modules contained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a new subdirectory in the security databases directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the SQLite databases are designed to be shared, these are the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared database type. The shared database type is preferred; the legacy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; format is included for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, the tools (certutil, pk12util, modutil) assume that the given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security databases follow the more common legacy type. Using the SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases must be manually specified by using the sql: prefix with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; given security directory. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ certutil -L -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the shared database type as the default type for the tools, set the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE environment variable to sql:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;export NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This line can be set added to the ~/.bashrc file to make the change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most applications do not use the shared database by default, but they can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be configured to use them. For example, this how-to article covers how to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configure Firefox and Thunderbird to use the new shared NSS databases:<br>

Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cmsutil command-line uses the S/MIME Toolkit to perform basic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; operations, such as encryption and decryption, on Cryptographic Message<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Syntax (CMS) messages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To run cmsutil, type the command cmsutil option [arguments] where option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and arguments are combinations of the options and arguments listed in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; following section. Each command takes one option. Each option may take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; zero or more arguments. To see a usage string, issue the command without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; options.<br>
<br>
Options and Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options specify an action. Option arguments modify an action. The options<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and arguments for the cmsutil command are defined as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -D<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decode a message.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; crlutil — List, generate, modify, or delete CRLs within the NSS security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database file(s) and list, create, modify or delete certificates entries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in a particular CRL.<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; crlutil [options] <a href="arguments">arguments</a><br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Management Tool, crlutil, is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command-line utility that can list, generate, modify, or delete CRLs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; within the NSS security database file(s) and list, create, modify or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; delete certificates entries in a particular CRL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The key and certificate management process generally begins with creating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; keys in the key database, then generating and managing certificates in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate database(see certutil tool) and continues with certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; expiration or revocation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This document discusses certificate revocation list management. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information on security module database management, see Using the Security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Module Database Tool. For information on certificate and key database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; management, see Using the Certificate Database Tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To run the Certificate Revocation List Management Tool, type the command<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; crlutil option [arguments]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; where options and arguments are combinations of the options and arguments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; listed in the following section. Each command takes one option. Each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; option may take zero or more arguments. To see a usage string, issue the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command without options, or with the -H option.<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -P dbprefix<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the prefix used on the NSS security database files (for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, my_cert8.db and my_key3.db). This option is provided as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special case. Changing the names of the certificate and key<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases is not recommended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -a<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use ASCII format or allow the use of ASCII format for input and<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -c crl-gen-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify script file that will be used to control crl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generation/modification. See crl-cript-file format below. If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; options -M|-G is used and -c crl-script-file is not specified,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database files. On Unix the Certificate Database Tool defaults to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $HOME/.netscape (that is, ~/.netscape). On Windows NT the default<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the current directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSS database files must reside in the same directory.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a file that will automatically supply the password to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include in a certificate or to access a certificate database. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a plain-text file containing one password. Be sure to prevent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unauthorized access to this file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -l algorithm-name<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a specific signature algorithm. List of possible<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; argument is not used the output destination defaults to standard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -t crl-type<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify type of CRL. possible types are: 0 - SEC_KRL_TYPE, 1 -<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SEC_CRL_TYPE. This option is obsolete<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -u url<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the url.<br>
<br>
CRL Generation script syntax<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; CRL generation script file has the following syntax:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Line with comments should have # as a first symbol of a line<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Set "this update" or "next update" CRL fields:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; update=YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ nextupdate=YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Field "next update" is optional. Time should be in GeneralizedTime format<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ). For example: 20050204153000Z<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add an extension to a CRL or a crl certificate entry:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; addext extension-name critical/non-critical [arg1[arg2 ...]]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; extension-name: string value of a name of known extensions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; critical/non-critical: is 1 when extension is critical and 0 otherwise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; arg1, arg2: specific to extension type extension parameters<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; addext uses the range that was set earlier by addcert and will install an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; extension to every cert entries within the range.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add certificate entries(s) to CRL:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; addcert range date<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; range: two integer values separated by dash: range of certificates that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will be added by this command. dash is used as a delimiter. Only one cert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will be added if there is no delimiter. date: revocation date of a cert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Date should be represented in GeneralizedTime format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remove certificate entry(s) from CRL<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rmcert range<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; range: two integer values separated by dash: range of certificates that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will be added by this command. dash is used as a delimiter. Only one cert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; will be added if there is no delimiter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Change range of certificate entry(s) in CRL<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; range new-range<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; new-range: two integer values separated by dash: range of certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that will be added by this command. dash is used as a delimiter. Only one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cert will be added if there is no delimiter.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Implemented Extensions<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The extensions defined for CRL provide methods for associating additional<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; attributes with CRLs of theirs entries. For more information see RFC #3280<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add The Authority Key Identifier extension:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The authority key identifier extension provides a means of identifying the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public key corresponding to the private key used to sign a CRL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; authKeyId critical [key-id | dn cert-serial]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; authKeyIdent: identifies the name of an extension critical: value of 1 of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 0. Should be set to 1 if this extension is critical or 0 otherwise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; key-id: key identifier represented in octet string. dn:: is a CA<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; distinguished name cert-serial: authority certificate serial number.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add Issuer Alternative Name extension:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The issuer alternative names extension allows additional identities to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; associated with the issuer of the CRL. Defined options include an rfc822<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; name (electronic mail address), a DNS name, an IP address, and a URI.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; issuerAltNames non-critical name-list<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; subjAltNames: identifies the name of an extension should be set to 0 since<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this is non-critical extension name-list: comma separated list of names<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add CRL Number extension:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The CRL number is a non-critical CRL extension which conveys a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; monotonically increasing sequence number for a given CRL scope and CRL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; issuer. This extension allows users to easily determine when a particular<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; CRL supersedes another CRL<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; crlNumber non-critical number<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; crlNumber: identifies the name of an extension critical: should be set to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 since this is non-critical extension number: value of long which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; identifies the sequential number of a CRL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add Revocation Reason Code extension:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The reasonCode is a non-critical CRL entry extension that identifies the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; reason for the certificate revocation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonCode non-critical code<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; reasonCode: identifies the name of an extension non-critical: should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; set to 0 since this is non-critical extension code: the following codes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are available:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; unspecified (0), keyCompromise (1), cACompromise (2), affiliationChanged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (3), superseded (4), cessationOfOperation (5), certificateHold (6),<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; removeFromCRL (8), privilegeWithdrawn (9), aACompromise (10)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Add Invalidity Date extension:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The invalidity date is a non-critical CRL entry extension that provides<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the date on which it is known or suspected that the private key was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; compromised or that the certificate otherwise became invalid.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; invalidityDate non-critical date<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; crlNumber: identifies the name of an extension non-critical: should be set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to 0 since this is non-critical extension date: invalidity date of a cert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Date should be represented in GeneralizedTime format (YYYYMMDDhhmmssZ).<br>
<br>
Usage<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Certificate Revocation List Management Tool's capabilities are grouped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; as follows, using these combinations of options and arguments. Options and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments in square brackets are optional, those without square brackets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are required.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil — Manage PKCS #11 module information within the security module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil [options] <a href="arguments">arguments</a><br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Security Module Database Tool, modutil, is a command-line utility for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; managing PKCS #11 module information both within secmod.db files and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; within hardware tokens. modutil can add and delete PKCS #11 modules,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; change passwords on security databases, set defaults, list module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; contents, enable or disable slots, enable or disable FIPS 140-2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; compliance, and assign default providers for cryptographic operations.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This tool can also create certificate, key, and module security database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tasks associated with security module database management are part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a process that typically also involves managing key databases and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate databases.<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Running modutil always requires one (and only one) option to specify the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; type of module operation. Each option may take arguments, anywhere from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; none to multiple arguments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -add modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the named PKCS #11 module to the database. Use this option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the -libfile, -ciphers, and -mechanisms arguments.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -changepw tokenname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the password on the named token. If the token has not been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initialized, this option initializes the password. Use this option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the -pwfile and -newpwfile arguments. A password is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equivalent to a personal identification number (PIN).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -chkfips<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify whether the module is in the given FIPS mode. true means to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verify that the module is in FIPS mode, while false means to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; verify that the module is not in FIPS mode.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -create<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create new certificate, key, and module databases. Use the -dbdir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory argument to specify a directory. If any of these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases already exist in a specified directory, modutil returns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an error message.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -default modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the security mechanisms for which the named module will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a default provider. The security mechanisms are specified with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -mechanisms argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -delete modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the named module. The default NSS PKCS #11 module cannot be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deleted.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -disable modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable all slots on the named module. Use the -slot argument to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disable a specific slot.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -enable modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable all slots on the named module. Use the -slot argument to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enable a specific slot.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -fips [true | false]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable (true) or disable (false) FIPS 140-2 compliance for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default NSS module.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -force<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disable modutil's interactive prompts so it can be run from a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; script. Use this option only after manually testing each planned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operation to check for warnings and to ensure that bypassing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prompts will cause no security lapses or loss of database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integrity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -jar JAR-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add a new PKCS #11 module to the database using the named JAR<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file. Use this command with the -installdir and -tempdir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments. The JAR file uses the NSS PKCS #11 JAR format to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify all the files to be installed, the module's name, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanism flags, and the cipher flags, as well as any files to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; installed on the target machine, including the PKCS #11 module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; library file and other files such as documentation. This is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; covered in the JAR installation file section in the man page,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which details the special script needed to perform an installation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through a server or with modutil.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -list [modulename]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display basic information about the contents of the secmod.db<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file. Specifying a modulename displays detailed information about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a particular module and its slots and tokens.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -rawadd<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add the module spec string to the secmod.db database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -rawlist<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display the module specs for a specified module or for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loadable modules.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -undefault modulename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the security mechanisms for which the named module will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not be a default provider. The security mechanisms are specified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the -mechanisms argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; MODULE<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the security module to access.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; MODULESPEC<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the security module spec to load into the security database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -ciphers cipher-enable-list<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable specific ciphers in a module that is being added to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database. The cipher-enable-list is a colon-delimited list of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cipher names. Enclose this list in quotation marks if it contains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spaces.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -dbdir [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the database directory in which to access or create<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security module database files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil supports two types of databases: the legacy security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt). If the prefix sql:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not used, then the tool assumes that the given databases are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old format.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --dbprefix prefix<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the prefix used on the database files, such as my_ for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my_cert8.db. This option is provided as a special case. Changing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the names of the certificate and key databases is not recommended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -installdir root-installation-directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the root installation directory relative to which files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will be installed by the -jar option. This directory should be one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below which it is appropriate to store dynamic library files, such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as a server's root directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -libfile library-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a path to a library file containing the implementation of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the PKCS #11 interface module that is being added to the database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -mechanisms mechanism-list<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the security mechanisms for which a particular module will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be flagged as a default provider. The mechanism-list is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colon-delimited list of mechanism names. Enclose this list in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; quotation marks if it contains spaces.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The module becomes a default provider for the listed mechanisms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when those mechanisms are enabled. If more than one module claims<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to be a particular mechanism's default provider, that mechanism's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default provider is undefined.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil supports several mechanisms: RSA, DSA, RC2, RC4, RC5, AES,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DES, DH, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SSL, TLS, MD5, MD2, RANDOM (for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; random number generation), and FRIENDLY (meaning certificates are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; publicly readable).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -newpwfile new-password-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a text file containing a token's new or replacement<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password so that a password can be entered automatically with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -changepw option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -nocertdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not open the certificate or key databases. This has several<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; effects:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;With the -create command, only a module security file is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; created; certificate and key databases are not created.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;With the -jar command, signatures on the JAR file are not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; checked.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;With the -changepw command, the password on the NSS internal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; module cannot be set or changed, since this password is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stored in the key database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -pwfile old-password-file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a text file containing a token's existing password so that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a password can be entered automatically when the -changepw option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is used to change passwords.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -secmod secmodname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give the name of the security module database (like secmod.db) to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; load.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -slot slotname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify a particular slot to be enabled or disabled with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -enable or -disable options.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -string CONFIG_STRING<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass a configuration string for the module being added to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -tempdir temporary-directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give a directory location where temporary files are created during<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the installation by the -jar option. If no temporary directory is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified, the current directory is used.<br>
<br>
Usage and Examples<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating Database Files<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before any operations can be performed, there must be a set of security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases available. modutil can be used to create these files. The only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; required argument is the database that where the databases will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; located.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -create -dbdir [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding a Cryptographic Module<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding a PKCS #11 module means submitting a supporting library file,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enabling its ciphers, and setting default provider status for various<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security mechanisms. This can be done by supplying all of the information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; through modutil directly or by running a JAR file and install script. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the most basic case, simply upload the library:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -add modulename -libfile library-file [-ciphers cipher-enable-list] [-mechanisms mechanism-list]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -add "Example PKCS #11 Module" -libfile "/tmp/crypto.so" -mechanisms RSA:DSA:RC2:RANDOM<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Using database directory ...<br>
&nbsp;Module "Example PKCS #11 Module" added to database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Installing a Cryptographic Module from a JAR File<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PKCS #11 modules can also be loaded using a JAR file, which contains all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of the required libraries and an installation script that describes how to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; install the module. The JAR install script is described in more detail in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; [1]the section called “JAR Installation File Format”.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The JAR installation script defines the setup information for each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; platform that the module can be installed on. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Platforms {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linux:5.4.08:x86 {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ModuleName { "Example PKCS #11 Module" }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ModuleFile { crypto.so }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DefaultMechanismFlags{0x0000}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CipherEnableFlags{0x0000}<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Files {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crypto.so {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Path{ /tmp/crypto.so }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setup.sh {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Executable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Path{ /tmp/setup.sh }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linux:6.0.0:x86 {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EquivalentPlatform { Linux:5.4.08:x86 }<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
&nbsp;}<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Both the install script and the required libraries must be bundled in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; JAR file, which is specified with the -jar argument.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -dbdir sql:/home/mt"jar-install-filey/sharednssdb -jar install.jar -installdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>

&nbsp;Installation completed successfully<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding Module Spec<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each module has information stored in the security database about its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration and parameters. These can be added or edited using the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -rawadd command. For the current settings or to see the format of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; module spec in the database, use the -rawlist option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -rawadd modulespec<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleting a Module<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A specific PKCS #11 module can be deleted from the secmod.db database:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -delete modulename -dbdir [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Displaying Module Information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The secmod.db database contains information about the PKCS #11 modules<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that are available to an application or server to use. The list of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; modules, information about specific modules, and database configuration<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specs for modules can all be viewed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To simply get a list of modules in the database, use the -list command.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -list [modulename] -dbdir [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing the modules shows the module name, their status, and other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; associated security databases for certificates and keys. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -list -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Listing of PKCS #11 Modules<br>
&nbsp;-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slots: 2 slots attached<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status: loaded<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot: NSS Internal Cryptographic Services<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; token: NSS Generic Crypto Services<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slot: NSS User Private Key and Certificate Services<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; token: NSS Certificate DB<br>
&nbsp;-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing a specific module name with the -list returns details information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; about the module itself, like supported cipher mechanisms, version<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; numbers, serial numbers, and other information about the module and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; token it is loaded on. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; modutil -list "NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module" -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; A related command, -rawlist returns information about the database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configuration for the modules. (This information can be edited by loading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; new specs using the -rawadd command.)<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting a Default Provider for Security Mechanisms<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiple security modules may provide support for the same security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanisms. It is possible to set a specific security module as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default provider for a specific security mechanism (or, conversely, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; prohibit a provider from supplying those mechanisms).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -default modulename -mechanisms mechanism-list<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set a module as the default provider for mechanisms, use the -default<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command with a colon-separated list of mechanisms. The available<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanisms depend on the module; NSS supplies almost all common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanisms. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -default "NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module" -dbdir -mechanisms RSA:DSA:RC2<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Using database directory c:\databases...<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Successfully changed defaults.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearing the default provider has the same format:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -undefault "NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module" -dbdir -mechanisms MD2:MD5<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabling and Disabling Modules and Slots<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Modules, and specific slots on modules, can be selectively enabled or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; disabled using modutil. Both commands have the same format:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -enable|-disable modulename [-slot slotname]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -enable "NSS Internal PKCS #11 Module" -slot "NSS Internal Cryptographic Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " -dbdir .<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Slot "NSS Internal Cryptographic Services&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " enabled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure that the appropriate amount of trailing whitespace is after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; slot name. Some slot names have a significant amount of whitespace that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; must be included, or the operation will fail.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabling and Verifying FIPS Compliance<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The NSS modules can have FIPS 140-2 compliance enabled or disabled using<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; modutil with the -fips option. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -fips true -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb/<br>
<br>
&nbsp;FIPS mode enabled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To verify that status of FIPS mode, run the -chkfips command with either a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; true or false flag (it doesn't matter which). The tool returns the current<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; FIPS setting.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -chkfips false -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb/<br>
<br>
&nbsp;FIPS mode enabled.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing the Password on a Token<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Initializing or changing a token's password:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -changepw tokenname [-pwfile old-password-file] [-newpwfile new-password-file]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb -changepw "NSS Certificate DB"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Enter old password:<br>
&nbsp;Incorrect password, try again...<br>
&nbsp;Enter old password:<br>
&nbsp;Enter new password:<br>
&nbsp;Re-enter new password:<br>
&nbsp;Token "Communicator Certificate DB" password changed successfully.<br>
<br>
JAR Installation File Format<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When a JAR file is run by a server, by modutil, or by any program that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; does not interpret JavaScript, a special information file must be included<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to install the libraries. There are several things to keep in mind with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this file:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;It must be declared in the JAR archive's manifest file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;The script can have any name.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;The metainfo tag for this is Pkcs11_install_script. To declare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meta-information in the manifest file, put it in a file that is passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to signtool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sample Script<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, the PKCS #11 installer script could be in the file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; pk11install. If so, the metainfo file for signtool includes a line such as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;+ Pkcs11_install_script: pk11install<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The script must define the platform and version number, the module name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and file, and any optional information like supported ciphers and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; mechanisms. Multiple platforms can be defined in a single install file.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Script Grammar<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The script is basic Java, allowing lists, key-value pairs, strings, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; combinations of all of them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; valuelist<br>
<br>
&nbsp;valuelist --&gt; value valuelist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;null&gt;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;value ---&gt; key_value_pair<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string<br>
<br>
&nbsp;key_value_pair --&gt; key { valuelist }<br>
<br>
&nbsp;key --&gt; string<br>
<br>
&nbsp;string --&gt; simple_string<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "complex_string"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;simple_string --&gt; [^ \t\n\""{""}"]+<br>
<br>
&nbsp;complex_string --&gt; ([^\"\\\r\n]|(\\\")|(\\\\))+<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Quotes and backslashes must be escaped with a backslash. A complex string<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; must not include newlines or carriage returns.Outside of complex strings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; all white space (for example, spaces, tabs, and carriage returns) is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; considered equal and is used only to delimit tokens.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Java install file uses keys to define the platform and module<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ForwardCompatible gives a list of platforms that are forward compatible.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If the current platform cannot be found in the list of supported<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; platforms, then the ForwardCompatible list is checked for any platforms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that have the same OS and architecture in an earlier version. If one is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; found, its attributes are used for the current platform.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Platforms (required) Gives a list of platforms. Each entry in the list is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; itself a key-value pair: the key is the name of the platform and the value<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; list contains various attributes of the platform. The platform string is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in the format system name:OS release:architecture. The installer obtains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these values from NSPR. OS release is an empty string on non-Unix<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; operating systems. NSPR supports these platforms:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;AIX (rs6000)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;BSDI (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;FREEBSD (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;HPUX (hppa1.1)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;IRIX (mips)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;LINUX (ppc, alpha, x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;MacOS (PowerPC)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;NCR (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;NEC (mips)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;OS2 (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;OSF (alpha)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;ReliantUNIX (mips)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;SCO (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;SOLARIS (sparc)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;SONY (mips)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;SUNOS (sparc)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;UnixWare (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;WIN16 (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;WIN95 (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;WINNT (x86)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;IRIX:6.2:mips<br>
&nbsp;SUNOS:5.5.1:sparc<br>
&nbsp;Linux:2.0.32:x86<br>
&nbsp;WIN95::x86<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The module information is defined independently for each platform in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ModuleName, ModuleFile, and Files attributes. These attributes must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; given unless an EquivalentPlatform attribute is specified.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Per-Platform Keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Per-platform keys have meaning only within the value list of an entry in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Platforms list.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ModuleName (required) gives the common name for the module. This name is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; used to reference the module by servers and by the modutil tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ModuleFile (required) names the PKCS #11 module file for this platform.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The name is given as the relative path of the file within the JAR archive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Files (required) lists the files that need to be installed for this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; module. Each entry in the file list is a key-value pair. The key is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; path of the file in the JAR archive, and the value list contains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; attributes of the file. At least RelativePath or AbsolutePath must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specified for each file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DefaultMechanismFlags specifies mechanisms for which this module is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default provider; this is equivalent to the -mechanism option with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -add command. This key-value pair is a bitstring specified in hexadecimal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (0x) format. It is constructed as a bitwise OR. If the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DefaultMechanismFlags entry is omitted, the value defaults to 0x0.<br>

&nbsp;DISABLE:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x40000000<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; CipherEnableFlags specifies ciphers that this module provides that NSS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; does not provide (so that the module enables those ciphers for NSS). This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is equivalent to the -cipher argument with the -add command. This key is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; bitstring specified in hexadecimal (0x) format. It is constructed as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; bitwise OR. If the CipherEnableFlags entry is omitted, the value defaults<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to 0x0.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; EquivalentPlatform specifies that the attributes of the named platform<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; should also be used for the current platform. This makes it easier when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; more than one platform uses the same settings.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Per-File Keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some keys have meaning only within the value list of an entry in a Files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; list.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each file requires a path key the identifies where the file is. Either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; RelativePath or AbsolutePath must be specified. If both are specified, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; relative path is tried first, and the absolute path is used only if no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; relative root directory is provided by the installer program.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; RelativePath specifies the destination directory of the file, relative to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; some directory decided at install time. Two variables can be used in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; relative path: %root% and %temp%. %root% is replaced at run time with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; directory relative to which files should be installed; for example, it may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be the server's root directory. The %temp% directory is created at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning of the installation and destroyed at the end. The purpose of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; %temp% is to hold executable files (such as setup programs) or files that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are used by these programs. Files destined for the temporary directory are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; guaranteed to be in place before any executable file is run; they are not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; deleted until all executable files have finished.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; AbsolutePath specifies the destination directory of the file as an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; absolute path.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Executable specifies that the file is to be executed during the course of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the installation. Typically, this string is used for a setup program<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; provided by a module vendor, such as a self-extracting setup executable.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than one file can be specified as executable, in which case the files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are run in the order in which they are specified in the script file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; FilePermissions sets permissions on any referenced files in a string of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; octal digits, according to the standard Unix format. This string is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; bitwise OR.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;user read:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0400<br>
&nbsp;user write:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0200<br>
&nbsp;user execute:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0100<br>
&nbsp;group read:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0040<br>
&nbsp;group write:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0020<br>
&nbsp;group execute:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0010<br>
&nbsp;other read:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0004<br>
&nbsp;other write:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0002<br>
&nbsp;other execute:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0001<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some platforms may not understand these permissions. They are applied only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; insofar as they make sense for the current platform. If this attribute is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; omitted, a default of 777 is assumed.<br>
<br>
NSS Database Types<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS originally used BerkeleyDB databases to store security information.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last versions of these legacy databases are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert8.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key3.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;secmod.db for PKCS #11 module information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BerkeleyDB has performance limitations, though, which prevent it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being easily used by multiple applications simultaneously. NSS has some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; flexibility that allows applications to use their own, independent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database engine while keeping a shared database and working around the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; access issues. Still, NSS requires more flexibility to provide a truly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared security database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, NSS introduced a new set of databases that are SQLite databases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than BerkleyDB. These new databases provide more accessibility and<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the SQLite databases are designed to be shared, these are the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared database type. The shared database type is preferred; the legacy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; format is included for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, the tools (certutil, pk12util, modutil) assume that the given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security databases follow the more common legacy type. Using the SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases must be manually specified by using the sql: prefix with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; given security directory. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;modutil -create -dbdir sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the shared database type as the default type for the tools, set the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE environment variable to sql:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;export NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This line can be set added to the ~/.bashrc file to make the change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most applications do not use the shared database by default, but they can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be configured to use them. For example, this how-to article covers how to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configure Firefox and Thunderbird to use the new shared NSS databases:<br>

Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The PKCS #12 utility, pk12util, enables sharing certificates among any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; server that supports PKCS#12. The tool can import certificates and keys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; from PKCS#12 files into security databases, export certificates, and list<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates and keys.<br>
<br>
Options and Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -i p12file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Import keys and certificates from a PKCS#12 file into a security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -l p12file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; List the keys and certificates in PKCS#12 file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -o p12file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Export keys and certificates from the security database to a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PKCS#12 file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguments<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -n certname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the nickname of the cert and private key to export.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the database directory into which to import to or export<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from certificates and keys.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pk12util supports two types of databases: the legacy security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt). If the prefix sql:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not used, then the tool assumes that the given databases are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old format.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -P prefix<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the prefix used on the certificate and key databases. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option is provided as a special case. Changing the names of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate and key databases is not recommended.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -h tokenname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the name of the token to import into or export from.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -v<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encrypt the certificates and other meta-data.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -r<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dumps all of the data in raw (binary) form. This must be saved as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a DER file. The default is to return information in a pretty-print<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASCII format, which displays the information about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates and public keys in the p12 file.<br>

Examples<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Importing Keys and Certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The most basic usage of pk12util for importing a certificate or key is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PKCS#12 input file (-i) and some way to specify the security database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being accessed (either -d for a directory or -h for a token).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;pk12util -i p12File [-h tokenname] [-v] [-d [sql:]directory] [-P dbprefix] [-k slotPasswordFile|-K slotPassword] [-w p12filePasswordFile|-W p12filePassword]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;# pk12util -i /tmp/cert-files/users.p12 -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Enter a password which will be used to encrypt your keys.<br>
&nbsp;The password should be at least 8 characters long,<br>
&nbsp;and should contain at least one non-alphabetic character.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Enter new password:<br>
&nbsp;Re-enter password:<br>
&nbsp;Enter password for PKCS12 file:<br>
&nbsp;pk12util: PKCS12 IMPORT SUCCESSFUL<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exporting Keys and Certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the pk12util command to export certificates and keys requires both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the name of the certificate to extract from the database (-n) and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PKCS#12-formatted output file to write to. There are optional parameters<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that can be used to encrypt the file to protect the certificate material.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;pk12util -o p12File -n certname [-c keyCipher] [-C certCipher] [-m|--key_len keyLen] [-n|--cert_key_len certKeyLen] [-d [sql:]directory] [-P dbprefix] [-k slotPasswordFile|-K slotPassword] [-w p12filePasswordFile|-W p12filePassword]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;# pk12util -o certs.p12 -n Server-Cert -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
&nbsp;Enter password for PKCS12 file:<br>
&nbsp;Re-enter password:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Listing Keys and Certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The information in a .p12 file are not human-readable. The certificates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and keys in the file can be printed (listed) in a human-readable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty-print format that shows information for every certificate and any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; public keys in the .p12 file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;pk12util -l p12File [-h tokenname] [-r] [-d [sql:]directory] [-P dbprefix] [-k slotPasswordFile|-K slotPassword] [-w p12filePasswordFile|-W p12filePassword]<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, this prints the default ASCII output:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;# pk12util -l certs.p12<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Enter password for PKCS12 file:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, the -r prints the certificates and then exports them into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; separate DER binary files. This allows the certificates to be fed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; another application that supports .p12 files. Each certificate is written<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to a sequentially-number file, beginning with file0001.der and continuing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; through file000N.der, incrementing the number for every certificate:<br>

Password Encryption<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; PKCS#12 provides for not only the protection of the private keys but also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the certificate and meta-data associated with the keys. Password-based<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; encryption is used to protect private keys on export to a PKCS#12 file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and, optionally, the entire package. If no algorithm is specified, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; tool defaults to using PKCS12 V2 PBE with SHA1 and 3KEY Triple DES-cbc for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; private key encryption. PKCS12 V2 PBE with SHA1 and 40 Bit RC4 is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default for the overall package encryption when not in FIPS mode. When in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; FIPS mode, there is no package encryption.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The private key is always protected with strong encryption by default.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Several types of ciphers are supported.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; With PKCS#12, the crypto provider may be the soft token module or an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; external hardware module. If the cryptographic module does not support the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; requested algorithm, then the next best fit will be selected (usually the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default). If no suitable replacement for the desired algorithm can be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; found, the tool returns the error no security module can perform the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; requested operation.<br>
<br>
NSS Database Types<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS originally used BerkeleyDB databases to store security information.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last versions of these legacy databases are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert8.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key3.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;secmod.db for PKCS #11 module information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BerkeleyDB has performance limitations, though, which prevent it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being easily used by multiple applications simultaneously. NSS has some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; flexibility that allows applications to use their own, independent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database engine while keeping a shared database and working around the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; access issues. Still, NSS requires more flexibility to provide a truly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared security database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, NSS introduced a new set of databases that are SQLite databases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than BerkleyDB. These new databases provide more accessibility and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; performance:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert9.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key4.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;pkcs11.txt, which is listing of all of the PKCS #11 modules contained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a new subdirectory in the security databases directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the SQLite databases are designed to be shared, these are the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared database type. The shared database type is preferred; the legacy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; format is included for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, the tools (certutil, pk12util, modutil) assume that the given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security databases follow the more common legacy type. Using the SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases must be manually specified by using the sql: prefix with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; given security directory. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;# pk12util -i /tmp/cert-files/users.p12 -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the shared database type as the default type for the tools, set the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE environment variable to sql:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;export NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This line can be set added to the ~/.bashrc file to make the change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most applications do not use the shared database by default, but they can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be configured to use them. For example, this how-to article covers how to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configure Firefox and Thunderbird to use the new shared NSS databases:<br>

Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Signing Tool, signtool, creates digital signatures and uses a Java<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Archive (JAR) file to associate the signatures with files in a directory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Electronic software distribution over any network involves potential<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security problems. To help address some of these problems, you can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; associate digital signatures with the files in a JAR archive. Digital<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; signatures allow SSL-enabled clients to perform two important operations:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Confirm the identity of the individual, company, or other entity whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; digital signature is associated with the files<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * Check whether the files have been tampered with since being signed<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a signing certificate, you can use Netscape Signing Tool to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; digitally sign files and package them as a JAR file. An object-signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate is a special kind of certificate that allows you to associate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; your digital signature with one or more files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; An individual file can potentially be signed with multiple digital<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; signatures. For example, a commercial software developer might sign the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; files that constitute a software product to prove that the files are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; indeed from a particular company. A network administrator manager might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sign the same files with an additional digital signature based on a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; company-generated certificate to indicate that the product is approved for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; use within the company.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The significance of a digital signature is comparable to the significance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of a handwritten signature. Once you have signed a file, it is difficult<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to claim later that you didn't sign it. In some situations, a digital<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; signature may be considered as legally binding as a handwritten signature.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, you should take great care to ensure that you can stand behind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; any file you sign and distribute.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if you are a software developer, you should test your code to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; make sure it is virus-free before signing it. Similarly, if you are a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; network administrator, you should make sure, before signing any code, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; it comes from a reliable source and will run correctly with the software<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; installed on the machines to which you are distributing it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you can use Netscape Signing Tool to sign files, you must have an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; object-signing certificate, which is a special certificate whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; associated private key is used to create digital signatures. For testing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; purposes only, you can create an object-signing certificate with Netscape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing Tool 1.3. When testing is finished and you are ready to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; disitribute your software, you should obtain an object-signing certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; from one of two kinds of sources:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * An independent certificate authority (CA) that authenticates your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; identity and charges you a fee. You typically get a certificate from an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; independent CA if you want to sign software that will be distributed over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Internet.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; * CA server software running on your corporate intranet or extranet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape Certificate Management System provides a complete management<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; solution for creating, deploying, and managing certificates, including CAs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that issue object-signing certificates.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You must also have a certificate for the CA that issues your signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate before you can sign files. If the certificate authority's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate isn't already installed in your copy of Communicator, you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; typically install it by clicking the appropriate link on the certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; authority's web site, for example on the page from which you initiated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; enrollment for your signing certificate. This is the case for some test<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates, as well as certificates issued by Netscape Certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Management System: you must download the CA certificate in addition to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; obtaining your own signing certificate. CA certificates for several<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate authorities are preinstalled in the Communicator certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When you receive an object-signing certificate for your own use, it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; automatically installed in your copy of the Communicator client software.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicator supports the public-key cryptography standard known as PKCS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; #12, which governs key portability. You can, for example, move an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; object-signing certificate and its associated private key from one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; computer to another on a credit-card-sized device called a smart card.<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -b basename<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the base filename for the .rsa and .sf files in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; META-INF directory to conform with the JAR format. For example, -b<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signatures causes the files to be named signatures.rsa and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signatures.sf. The default is signtool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -c#<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the compression level for the -J or -Z option. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; symbol # represents a number from 0 to 9, where 0 means no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; compression and 9 means maximum compression. The higher the level<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of compression, the smaller the output but the longer the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operation takes. If the -c# option is not used with either the -J<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the -Z option, the default compression value used by both the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -J and -Z options is 6.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -d certdir<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies your certificate database directory; that is, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directory in which you placed your key3.db and cert7.db files. To<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify the current directory, use "-d." (including the period).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Unix version of signtool assumes ~/.netscape unless told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise. The NT version of signtool always requires the use of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the -d option to specify where the database files are located.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -e extension<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells signtool to sign only files with the given extension; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, use -e".class" to sign only Java class files. Note that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appear multiple times on one command line, making it possible to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specify multiple file types or classes to include.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -f commandfile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies a text file containing Netscape Signing Tool options and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arguments in keyword=value format. All options and arguments can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be expressed through this file. For more information about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; syntax used with this file, see "Tips and Techniques".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -i scriptname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the name of an installer script for SmartUpdate. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; script installs files from the JAR archive in the local system<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after SmartUpdate has validated the digital signature. For more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; details, see the description of -m that follows. The -i option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; provides a straightforward way to provide this information if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't need to specify any metadata other than an installer script.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -j directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies a special JavaScript directory. This option causes the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specified directory to be signed and tags its entries as inline<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JavaScript. This special type of entry does not have to appear in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the JAR file itself. Instead, it is located in the HTML page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; containing the inline scripts. When you use signtool -v, these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entries are displayed with the string NOT PRESENT.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -k key ... directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the nickname (key) of the certificate you want to sign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with and signs the files in the specified directory. The directory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to sign is always specified as the last command-line argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, it is possible to write signtool -k MyCert -d . signdir You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may have trouble if the nickname contains a single quotation mark.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid problems, escape the quotation mark using the escape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conventions for your platform. It's also possible to use the -k<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option without signing any files or specifying a directory. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; example, you can use it with the -l option to get detailed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information about a particular signing certificate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -G nickname<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Generates a new private-public key pair and corresponding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; object-signing certificate with the given nickname. The newly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate databases in the directory specified by the -d option.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option with the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool to install<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases. If you are installing the keys and certificate in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicator databases, you must exit Communicator before using<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this option; otherwise, you risk corrupting the databases. In all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cases, the certificate is also output to a file named x509.cacert,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which has the MIME-type application/x-x509-ca-cert. Unlike<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates normally used to sign finished code to be distributed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over a network, a test certificate created with -G is not signed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by a recognized certificate authority. Instead, it is self-signed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, a single test signing certificate functions as both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an object-signing certificate and a CA. When you are using it to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sign objects, it behaves like an object-signing certificate. When<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is imported into browser software such as Communicator, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; behaves like an object-signing CA and cannot be used to sign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objects. The -G option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and later versions only. By default, it produces only RSA<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates with 1024-byte keys in the internal token. However,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can use the -s option specify the required key size and the -t<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option to specify the token. For more information about the use of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the -G option, see "Generating Test Object-Signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificates""Generating Test Object-Signing Certificates" on page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1241.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -l<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lists signing certificates, including issuing CAs. If any of your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates are expired or invalid, the list will so specify.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option can be used with the -k option to list detailed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information about a particular signing certificate. The -l option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -J<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signs a directory of HTML files containing JavaScript and creates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as many archive files as are specified in the HTML tags. Even if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signtool creates more than one archive file, you need to supply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the key database password only once. The -J option is available<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions. The -J<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option cannot be used at the same time as the -Z option. If the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -c# option is not used with the -J option, the default compression<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; value is 6. Note that versions 1.1 and later of Netscape Signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tool correctly recognizes the CODEBASE attribute, allows paths to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be expressed for the CLASS and SRC attributes instead of filenames<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only, processes LINK tags and parses HTML correctly, and offers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearer error messages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -L<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lists the certificates in your database. An asterisk appears to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the left of the nickname for any certificate that can be used to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sign objects with signtool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --leavearc<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retains the temporary .arc (archive) directories that the -J<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option creates. These directories are automatically erased by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; default. Retaining the temporary directories can be an aid to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debugging.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -m metafile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the name of a metadata control file. Metadata is signed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information attached either to the JAR archive itself or to files<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within the archive. This metadata can be any ASCII string, but is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used mainly for specifying an installer script. The metadata file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contains one entry per line, each with three fields: field #1:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; file specification, or + if you want to specify global metadata<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is, metadata about the JAR archive itself or all entries in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the archive) field #2: the name of the data you are specifying;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for example: Install-Script field #3: data corresponding to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name in field #2 For example, the -i option uses the equivalent of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this line: + Install-Script: script.js This example associates a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MIME type with a file: movie.qt MIME-Type: video/quicktime For<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape DevEdge.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -M<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lists the PKCS #11 modules available to signtool, including smart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cards. The -M option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later versions only. For information on using Netscape Signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tool with smart cards, see "Using Netscape Signing Tool with Smart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cards". For information on using the -M option to verify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIPS-140-1 validated mode, see "Netscape Signing Tool and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FIPS-140-1".<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --norecurse<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blocks recursion into subdirectories when signing a directory's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contents or when parsing HTML.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -o<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimizes the archive for size. Use this only if you are signing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; very large archives containing hundreds of files. This option<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; makes the manifest files (required by the JAR format) considerably<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smaller, but they contain slightly less information.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --outfile outputfile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies a file to receive redirected output from Netscape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing Tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -p password<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies a password for the private-key database. Note that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password entered on the command line is displayed as plain text.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -s keysize<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the size of the key for generated certificate. Use the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -M option to find out what tokens are available. The -s option can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be used with the -G option only.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -t token<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies which available token should generate the key and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receive the certificate. Use the -M option to find out what tokens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are available. The -t option can be used with the -G option only.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -v archive<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays the contents of an archive and verifies the cryptographic<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integrity of the digital signatures it contains and the files with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which they are associated. This includes checking that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate for the issuer of the object-signing certificate is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; listed in the certificate database, that the CA's digital<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signature on the object-signing certificate is valid, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relevant certificates have not expired, and so on.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; --verbosity value<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets the quantity of information Netscape Signing Tool generates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in operation. A value of 0 (zero) is the default and gives full<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information. A value of -1 suppresses most messages, but not error<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; messages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -w archive<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays the names of signers of any files in the archive.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -x directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excludes the specified directory from signing. Note that with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option can appear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple times on one command line, making it possible to specify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; several particular directories to exclude.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -z<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tells signtool not to store the signing time in the digital<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signature. This option is useful if you want the expiration date<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the signature checked against the current date and time rather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the time the files were signed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -Z jarfile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creates a JAR file with the specified name. You must specify this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; option if you want signtool to create the JAR file; it does not do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so automatically. If you don't specify -Z, you must use an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; external ZIP tool to create the JAR file. The -Z option cannot be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used at the same time as the -J option. If the -c# option is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; used with the -Z option, the default compression value is 6.<br>
<br>
The Command File Format<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Entries in a Netscape Signing Tool command file have this general format:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; keyword=value Everything before the = sign on a single line is a keyword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and everything from the = sign to the end of line is a value. The value<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; may include = signs; only the first = sign on a line is interpreted. Blank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; lines are ignored, but white space on a line with keywords and values is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; assumed to be part of the keyword (if it comes before the equal sign) or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; part of the value (if it comes after the first equal sign). Keywords are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; case insensitive, values are generally case sensitive. Since the = sign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and newline delimit the value, it should not be quoted.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; For a list including CAs, use the -L option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Signing a File<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Create an empty directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;mkdir signdir<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Put some file into it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;echo boo &gt; signdir/test.f<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Specify the name of your object-signing certificate and sign the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; directory.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signtool -k MySignCert -Z testjar.jar signdir<br>
<br>
&nbsp;using key "MySignCert"<br>
&nbsp;using certificate directory: /u/jsmith/.netscape<br>
&nbsp;Generating signdir/META-INF/manifest.mf file..<br>
&nbsp;--&gt; test.f<br>
&nbsp;adding signdir/test.f to testjar.jar<br>
&nbsp;Generating signtool.sf file..<br>
&nbsp;Enter Password or Pin for "Communicator Certificate DB":<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP Utility<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To use Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP utility, you must have the utility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in your path environment variable. You should use the zip.exe utility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than pkzip.exe, which cannot handle long filenames. You can use a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ZIP utility instead of the -Z option to package a signed archive into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; JAR file after you have signed it:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;cd signdir<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; zip -r ../myjar.jar *<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; adding: META-INF/ (stored 0%)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; adding: META-INF/manifest.mf (deflated 15%)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; adding: META-INF/signtool.sf (deflated 28%)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; adding: META-INF/signtool.rsa (stored 0%)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; adding: text.txt (stored 0%)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Generating the Keys and Certificate<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The signtool option -G generates a new public-private key pair and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate. It takes the nickname of the new certificate as an argument.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The newly generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d option with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool, omitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the -d option causes the tool to install the keys and certificate in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicator key and certificate databases. In all cases, the certificate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; is also output to a file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; application/x-x509-ca-cert.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Certificates contain standard information about the entity they identify,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; such as the common name and organization name. Netscape Signing Tool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; prompts you for this information when you run the command with the -G<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; option. However, all of the requested fields are optional for test<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates. If you do not enter a common name, the tool provides a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default name. In the following example, the user input is in boldface:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signtool -G MyTestCert<br>
<br>
&nbsp;using certificate directory: /u/someuser/.netscape<br>
&nbsp;Enter certificate information. All fields are optional. Acceptable<br>
&nbsp;characters are numbers, letters, spaces, and apostrophes.<br>
&nbsp;certificate common name: Test Object Signing Certificate<br>
&nbsp;organization: Netscape Communications Corp.<br>
&nbsp;organization unit: Server Products Division<br>
&nbsp;state or province: California<br>
&nbsp;country (must be exactly 2 characters): US<br>
&nbsp;username: someuser<br>
&nbsp;email address: <a class=" link-mailto" href="mailto:someuser@netscape.com">someuser@netscape.com</a><br>
&nbsp;Enter Password or Pin for "Communicator Certificate DB": [Password will not echo]<br>
&nbsp;generated public/private key pair<br>
&nbsp;certificate request generated<br>
&nbsp;certificate has been signed<br>
&nbsp;certificate "MyTestCert" added to database<br>
&nbsp;Exported certificate to x509.raw and x509.cacert.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The certificate information is read from standard input. Therefore, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information can be read from a file using the redirection operator (&lt;) in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; some operating systems. To create a file for this purpose, enter each of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the seven input fields, in order, on a separate line. Make sure there is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; newline character at the end of the last line. Then run signtool with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; standard input redirected from your file as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signtool -G MyTestCert inputfile<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The prompts show up on the screen, but the responses will be automatically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; read from the file. The password will still be read from the console<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; unless you use the -p option to give the password on the command line.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the -M Option to List Smart Cards<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use the -M option to list the PKCS #11 modules, including smart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cards, that are available to signtool:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signtool -d "c:\netscape\users\jsmith" -M<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Using Netscape Signing Tool and a Smart Card to Sign Files<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The signtool command normally takes an argument of the -k option to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; specify a signing certificate. To sign with a smart card, you supply only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the fully qualified name of the certificate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see fully qualified certificate names when you run Communicator, click<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the Security button in Navigator, then click Yours under Certificates in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the left frame. Fully qualified names are of the format smart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; card:certificate, for example "MyCard:My Signing Cert". You use this name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; with the -k argument as follows:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signtool -k "MyCard:My Signing Cert" directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Verifying FIPS Mode<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; signver — Verify a detached PKCS#7 signature for a file.<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; signtool -A | -V -d directory [-a] [-i input_file] [-o output_file] [-s<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; signature_file] [-v]<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Signature Verification Tool, signver, is a simple command-line utility<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that unpacks a base-64-encoded PKCS#7 signed object and verifies the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; digital signature using standard cryptographic techniques. The Signature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification Tool can also display the contents of the signed object.<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -A<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Displays all of the information in the PKCS#7 signature.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -V<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verifies the digital signature.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -d [sql:]directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specify the database directory which contains the certificates and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; keys.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signver supports two types of databases: the legacy security<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert8.db, key3.db, and secmod.db) and new SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; databases (cert9.db, key4.db, and pkcs11.txt). If the prefix sql:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not used, then the tool assumes that the given databases are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the old format.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -a<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sets that the given signature file is in ASCII format.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -i input_file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives the input file for the object with signed data.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -o output_file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives the output file to which to write the results.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -s signature_file<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gives the input file for the digital signature.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -v<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enables verbose output.<br>
<br>
Extended Examples<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Verifying a Signature<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The -V option verifies that the signature in a given signature file is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; valid when used to sign the given object (from the input file).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signver -V -s signature_file -i signed_file -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signatureValid=yes<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Printing Signature Data<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The -A option prints all of the information contained in a signature file.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the -o option prints the signature file information to the given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; output file rather than stdout.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;signver -A -s signature_file -o output_file<br>
<br>
NSS Database Types<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS originally used BerkeleyDB databases to store security information.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The last versions of these legacy databases are:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert8.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key3.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;secmod.db for PKCS #11 module information<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; BerkeleyDB has performance limitations, though, which prevent it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; being easily used by multiple applications simultaneously. NSS has some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; flexibility that allows applications to use their own, independent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; database engine while keeping a shared database and working around the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; access issues. Still, NSS requires more flexibility to provide a truly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared security database.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2009, NSS introduced a new set of databases that are SQLite databases<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than BerkleyDB. These new databases provide more accessibility and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; performance:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;cert9.db for certificates<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;key4.db for keys<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;pkcs11.txt, which is listing of all of the PKCS #11 modules contained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a new subdirectory in the security databases directory<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the SQLite databases are designed to be shared, these are the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shared database type. The shared database type is preferred; the legacy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; format is included for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By default, the tools (certutil, pk12util, modutil) assume that the given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; security databases follow the more common legacy type. Using the SQLite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; databases must be manually specified by using the sql: prefix with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; given security directory. For example:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;# signver -A -s signature -d sql:/home/my/sharednssdb<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the shared database type as the default type for the tools, set the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE environment variable to sql:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;export NSS_DEFAULT_DB_TYPE="sql"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; This line can be set added to the ~/.bashrc file to make the change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; permanent.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most applications do not use the shared database by default, but they can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; be configured to use them. For example, this how-to article covers how to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; configure Firefox and Thunderbird to use the new shared NSS databases:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; ssltap — Tap into SSL connections and display the data going by<br>
<br>
Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; libssltap [-vhfsxl] [-p port] [hostname:port]<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The SSL Debugging Tool ssltap is an SSL-aware command-line proxy. It<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; watches TCP connections and displays the data going by. If a connection is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; SSL, the data display includes interpreted SSL records and handshaking<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -v<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Print a version string for the tool.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -h<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on hex/ASCII printing. Instead of outputting raw data, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command interprets each record as a numbered line of hex values,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; followed by the same data as ASCII characters. The two parts are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separated by a vertical bar. Nonprinting characters are replaced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by dots.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -f<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on fancy printing. Output is printed in colored HTML. Data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sent from the client to the server is in blue; the server's reply<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is in red. When used with looping mode, the different connections<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are separated with horizontal lines. You can use this option to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upload the output into a browser.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -s<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on SSL parsing and decoding. The tool does not automatically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detect SSL sessions. If you are intercepting an SSL connection,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use this option so that the tool can detect and decode SSL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structures.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the tool detects a certificate chain, it saves the DER-encoded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certificates into files in the current directory. The files are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; named cert.0x, where x is the sequence number of the certificate.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the -s option is used with -h, two separate parts are printed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for each record: the plain hex/ASCII output, and the parsed SSL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -x<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on hex/ASCII printing of undecoded data inside parsed SSL<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; records. Used only with the -s option. This option uses the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; output format as the -h option.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -l prefix<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on looping; that is, continue to accept connections rather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than stopping after the first connection is complete.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -p port<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the default rendezvous port (1924) to another port.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following are well-known port numbers:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * HTTP 80<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * HTTPS 443<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * SMTP 25<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * FTP 21<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * IMAP 143<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * IMAPS 993 (IMAP over SSL)<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * NNTP 119<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * NNTPS 563 (NNTP over SSL)<br>
<br>
Usage and Examples<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You can use the SSL Debugging Tool to intercept any connection<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information. Although you can run the tool at its most basic by issuing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the ssltap command with no options other than hostname:port, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; information you get in this way is not very useful. For example, assume<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; your development machine is called intercept. The simplest way to use the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; debugging tool is to execute the following command from a command shell:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;$ ssltap www.netscape.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The program waits for an incoming connection on the default port 1924. In<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; your browser window, enter the URL <a class=" external" href="http://intercept:1924">http://intercept:1924</a>. The browser<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; retrieves the requested page from the server at www.netscape.com, but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; page is intercepted and passed on to the browser by the debugging tool on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; intercept. On its way to the browser, the data is printed to the command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; shell from which you issued the command. Data sent from the client to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; server is surrounded by the following symbols: --&gt; [ data ] Data sent from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the server to the client is surrounded by the following symbols: "left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; arrow"-- [ data ] The raw data stream is sent to standard output and is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; not interpreted in any way. This can result in peculiar effects, such as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; sounds, flashes, and even crashes of the command shell window. To output a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; basic, printable interpretation of the data, use the -h option, or, if you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are looking at an SSL connection, the -s option. You will notice that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; page you retrieved looks incomplete in the browser. This is because, by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; default, the tool closes down after the first connection is complete, so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the browser is not able to load images. To make the tool continue to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; accept connections, switch on looping mode with the -l option. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; following examples show the output from commonly used combinations of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; options.<br>

&nbsp;$ ssltap.exe -sx -p 444 interzone.mcom.com:443 &gt; sx.txt<br>

Usage Tips<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; When SSL restarts a previous session, it makes use of cached information<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to do a partial handshake. If you wish to capture a full SSL handshake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; restart the browser to clear the session id cache.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; If you run the tool on a machine other than the SSL server to which you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are trying to connect, the browser will complain that the host name you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are trying to connect to is different from the certificate. If you are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; using the default BadCert callback, you can still connect through a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; dialog. If you are not using the default BadCert callback, the one you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; supply must allow for this possibility.<br>

Synopsis<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; vfychain<br>
<br>
Description<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The verification Tool, vfychain, verifies certificate chains. modutil can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; add and delete PKCS #11 modules, change passwords on security databases,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; set defaults, list module contents, enable or disable slots, enable or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; disable FIPS 140-2 compliance, and assign default providers for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; cryptographic operations. This tool can also create certificate, key, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; module security database files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tasks associated with security module database management are part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a process that typically also involves managing key databases and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; certificate databases.<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; -a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the following certfile is base64 encoded<br>
