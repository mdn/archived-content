<p>There are not significant restrictions on what locales can change. However, we need to work together on providing search engines for Thunderbird users to use to get the right balance of search engines and the correct options set.</p>

<h3 id="Guidelines_for_Search_Plugins"><span class="mw-headline" id="Search">Guidelines for Search Plugins</span></h3>

<p>There are typically six search plugins listed.</p>

<h4 id="Generic_search_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Generic_search">Generic search</span></h4>

<p>The default option should expose the quickest path to the best result on the world wide web for the user (indexing a large portion of the global www). Global search. The second position can be used for the next best local language provider, meaning, coverage within the local language and/or locale (indexing a smaller portion of the www but producing better local language results). Local search. A good test is if you were to run a set of comparative queries; the secondary engine should produce the best local language results and the primary/default position should produce the best global results</p>

<h4 id="e-Commerce_search_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="e-Commerce_search">e-Commerce search</span></h4>

<p>These search engines should allow users to get connected to new and used products they want to buy as quickly and painlessly as possible in a "trusted" site. For example choosing the most popular auction, general shopping, or classified type sites that have the desired user experience are good choices. There should be no more than two.</p>

<h4 id="Specific_interest_search_2"><span class="mw-headline" id="Specific_interest_search">Specific interest search</span></h4>

<p>Where user are using popular search engine's to search more specific areas of interest that are very popular in your language or locale. There should be no more than two.</p>

<p>In all cases user experience should be taken into account and given preference for what is desired in that language/locale. if you have questions about what that means, please contact Philipp Kewisch via email (mozilla at kewis.ch) or Fallen on IRC.</p>

<h3 id="Search_Plugins_Requirements">Search Plugins Requirements</h3>

<p>en-US includes a set of default search plugins. Localizers are welcomed to use the local version of any of these providers (please indicate that in your web services or productization tracking bug).  Localizers are also welcomed to offer other suggestions that are more relevant to their locales based on the <span class="mw-redirect"> guidelines above</span> and <strong>must file a bug</strong> to have the suggestion reviewed (see below).</p>

<p>Localizers are free to translate the names of the search engines unless specifically prohibited by the engine's terms of service. If you have any questions, please ask.</p>

<p>If you are wishing to use the same defaults as for the en-US locale, please only land list.txt, do not copy the xml files in the searchplugins directory.</p>

<h4 id="What_Needs_Review">What Needs Review</h4>
