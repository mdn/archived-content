<p>For more and more people mobile devices are the primary way, or even the only way, to access the Web.<a class="link-https" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mobile/"> Firefox for iOS</a> (codenamed Fennec like its Android counterpart) is an open, hackable, standards-based browser, just like the desktop Firefox.</p>

<p>Firefox for iOS constructs its user interface from native widgets instead of <a href="/en-US/docs/Archive/Mozilla/XUL">XUL</a>; this greatly improves performance, especially startup time, and memory consumption. Because of Apple's App Store restrictions, it also uses the built‑in iOS <code>WKWebView</code>, which is based on WebKit rather than Gecko.</p>

<p>Its not possible to change the default browser on iOS. Because of that, users that want to use a third party browser have to resort to copy-paste tricks. Alternatively, there are some things you can do in your native apps to make these users happy:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Make the iOS App extensions system available to your users. Firefox for iOS provides some app extensions that make opening, bookmarking, and adding to the Firefox Reading List possible from your app. nshipster has a <a class="external external-icon" href="https://nshipster.com/uiactivityviewcontroller/">good overview</a> on how to add a UIActivityViewController to you app.</li>
 <li>Use the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios-open-in-client">Open-In-Firefox SDK</a> to easily detect if Firefox is installed and show it as an option for your users. In future releases, this will also make it easy for users to return to your app after reading an article in Firefox.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Addons">Addons</h2>

<p>Firefox for iOS supports the native iOS extension ecosystem right now, but doesn't (yet) support JavaScript add-ons like Desktop or Android Firefox.</p>

<p>There is ongoing work to get <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Themes/Lightweight_themes">Lightweight themes</a> to work in {{bug(1210119)}} and <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/theme">WebExtension‑based themes</a> in {{bug(1466496)}}.</p>
