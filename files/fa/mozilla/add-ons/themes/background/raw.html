 <li>Dimensions should be <strong>3000px wide × 200px high</strong></li>
 <li>PNG or JPG file format</li>

<ul>
 <li>Subtle, soft contrast images and gradients work best; highly detailed images will compete with the browser UI.</li>
 <li>Firefox may reveal more of the lower portion of the image if another toolbar or other UI element is added to the top of the window.</li>
 <li>The upper right-hand side of the image should have the most important information—as a user increases the width of the browser window, the browser reveals more of the left-hand side of the image.</li>
