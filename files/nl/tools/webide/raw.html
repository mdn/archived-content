<p>WebIDE enables you to create, edit, run, and debug web apps using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator">Firefox OS Simulator</a> or a real Firefox OS device.</p>

<p>It also enables you to connect the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox Developer Tools</a> to a number of other browsers, including Firefox for Android, Chrome on Android, and Safari on iOS. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Remote_Debugging">Remote Debugging</a> page for instructions on how to connect to a specific browser.</p>
</div>

<p>With WebIDE, you first <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Setting_up_runtimes">set up one or more runtimes</a>. A runtime is an environment in which you'll run and debug the app. A runtime could be a Firefox OS device connected to the desktop over USB (or over Wi-Fi since <a href="/en-US/Firefox/Releases/39">Firefox 39</a>), or it could be a Firefox OS Simulator installed on the desktop itself.</p>

<p>Next, you <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Creating_and_editing_apps">create an app, or open an existing app</a>. If you're creating a new app you can start with a template that includes the directory structure and the minimum boilerplate you need to get started, or a more complete template that shows how to use a privileged API. WebIDE shows your app's files in a tree, and you can edit and save them using a built-in source editor. Of course, you don't have to use the built-in editor: you can develop your app entirely outside WebIDE, and only use it for debugging.</p>

<p>Finally, you can <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE/Running_and_debugging_apps">install the app in one of the runtimes and run it</a>. You can then open the usual suite of developer tools - the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector">Inspector</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Console</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger">JavaScript Debugger</a> and so on - to examine and modify the running app.</p>
