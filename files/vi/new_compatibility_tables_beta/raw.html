<p>You're probably here because you followed the beta notice link from one of our new compatibility tables. (No? Want to see the new tables? <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Be_a_beta_tester">Make yourself a beta tester.</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks for helping us test these. They're part of a much larger project. We're moving all our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">browser compatibility data into structured JSON</a>.</p>

<p>The new tables will appear on pages as the data is converted to the new format.</p>

<h2 id="Editing">Editing</h2>

<p>Our compat data has been moved into JSON files in the<a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data"> browser-compat-data GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>To contribute compat data you can now submit a pull request or file an issue on the repository.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_help">How to help</h2>

<p>If you find a problem with the data please <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">file an issue on the GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>If something is wrong with the table's appearance or functionality, please click the <strong>"report an error"</strong> button in the drop down menu above the table.</p>

<p>Nếu bạn có thời gian, chúng tôi sẽ rất cảm kích nếu bạn <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/2342437/0b5ff6b6b8f6">tham gia khảo sát</a>.</p>
