    <dl>
     <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Memory" title="en/Performance/Profiling with the Built-in Profiler">The Developer Tools "Memory" panel</a></dt>
     <dd>The memory panel in the devtools supports taking heap snapshots, diffing them, computing dominator trees to surface "heavy retainers", and recording allocation stacks.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/about:memory">about:memory</a></dt>
     <dd>about:memory is the easiest-to-use tool for measuring memory usage in Mozilla code, and is the best place to start. It also lets you do other memory-related operations like trigger GC and CC, dump GC &amp; CC logs, and dump DMD reports. about:memory is built on top of Firefox's <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Memory_reporting">memory reporting</a> infrastructure.</dd>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/DMD">DMD</a></dt>
     <dd>DMD is a tool that identifies shortcomings in about:memory's measurements, and can also do multiple kinds of general heap profiling.</dd>
     <dt><a href="https://areweslimyet.com/">areweslimyet.com</a></dt>
     <dd>areweslimyet.com (a.k.a. AWSY) is a memory usage and regression tracker.</dd>
     <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/BloatView">BloatView</a></dt>
     <dd>BloatView prints per-class statistics on allocations and refcounts, and provides gross numbers on the amount of memory being leaked broken down by class. It is used as part of Mozilla's continuous integration testing.</dd>
     <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Refcount_tracing_and_balancing">Refcount tracing and balancing</a></dt>
     <dd>Refcount tracing and balancing are ways to track down leaks caused by incorrect uses of reference counting. They are slow and not particular easy to use, and thus most suitable for use by expert developers.</dd>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/GC_and_CC_logs">GC and CC logs</a></dt>
     <dd>GC and CC logs can be generated and analyzed to in various ways. In particular, they can help you understand why a particular object is being kept alive.</dd>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Valgrind">Valgrind</a></dt>
     <dd><a class="external text" href="http://valgrind.org/" rel="nofollow">Valgrind</a> is a tool that detects various memory-related problems at runtime, including leaks. Valgrind is used as <a class="external text" href="/en-US/docs/Valgrind_test_job" rel="nofollow">part</a> of Mozilla's continuous integration testing, though the coverage is limited because Valgrind is slow.</dd>
     <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Testing/Firefox_and_Address_Sanitizer#LeakSanitizer">LeakSanitizer</a></dt>
     <dd><span class="external text">LeakSanitizer</span> (a.k.a. LSAN) is similar to Valgrind, but it runs faster because it uses static source code instrumentation. LSAN is part of Mozilla's continuous integration testing, with most tests running through it as part of the AddressSanitizer (a.k.a. ASAN) test jobs.</dd>
     <dt><a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/FindingLeaks.html">Apple tools</a></dt>
     <dd>Apple provides <span class="external text">some tools</span> for Mac OS X that report similar problems to those reported by LSAN and Valgrind. The "leaks" tool is not recommended for use with SpiderMonkey or Firefox, because it gets confused by tagged pointers and thinks objects have leaked when they have not (see <a class="external text" href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=390944" rel="nofollow">bug 390944</a>).</dd>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Leak_Gauge">Leak Gauge</a></dt>
     <dd>Leak Gauge is a tool that can be used to detect certain kinds of leaks in Gecko, including those involving documents, window objects, and docshells.</dd>
     <dt><a href="http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/memory/replace/logalloc/README">LogAlloc</a></dt>
     <dd>LogAlloc is a tool that dumps a log of memory allocations in Gecko. That log can then be replayed against Firefox's default memory allocator independently or through another replace-malloc library, allowing the testing of other allocators under the exact same workload.</dd>
     <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/Memory_Profiler">Memory Profiler</a></dt>
     <dd>The memory profiler samples allocation events and provides different views to analyze the allocation characteristic.</dd>
